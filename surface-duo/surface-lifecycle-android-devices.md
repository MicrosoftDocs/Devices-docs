# Surface Lifecycle for Android-based devices

The Surface Lifecycle for Android-based devices covers Android version and security updates for Surface Duo. The lifecycle begins when a device is first released and concludes when Surface ceases publication of updates.

## Surface Android device support 

Surface Android devices will receive Android version and security updates for at least 3 years from its release date (September 10, 2020). In cases where the support duration is longer than 3 years, an updated end of servicing date will be published 18 months before expiration of the last planned servicing date. 

The following table outlines support information for Surface Duo:
