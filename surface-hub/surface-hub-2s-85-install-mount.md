# Install and mount Surface Hub 2S 85”

This article provides guidance for physically installing Microsoft Surface Hub 2S 85" in commercial environments. 

## Handling and site prep

- The device is very heavy. To reduce the risk of personal injury, death, or damage to the device due to its size and weight, it is important to keep the device upright.
- Before moving the device to the place where it will be installed, survey the site to determine how to safely move it to the location where it will be unpacked and mounted.
- Always use at least two people for unpacking and installation.
- Once the device is unpacked, it should be mounted
immediately, so the mounting system should be in place before unpacking. If you’re mounting onto a rolling stand, lock or block the wheels of the stand before unpacking.
- To avoid tripping hazards, keep the assembly area clear of packing materials.

> [!WARNING]
> Heavy object/ergonomic lifting
> The device is very heavy. To reduce the risk of lifting-related injuries, death, or damage to the device, we recommend that a minimum of two or more people lift the device. It is important to use proper lifting posture when lifting and/or moving the device.

Use good ergonomic lifting practices, including but not limited to:

## Mounting Surface Hub 2S 85" 

The Surface Hub 2S 85” uses a 600 x 600 VESA mount pattern. As shown in the following image, Microsoft has partnered with Steelcase to create mounting options compatible with the Surface Hub 2S 85” unique design. Customers interested in non-Steelcase mounting options will need to source appropriate spacers to account for the compute enclosure on the back of the device. Spacers will be available through [Salamander Designs](http://www.salamandercommercial.com/surface-hub-2).
