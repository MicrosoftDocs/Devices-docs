## Mounting Surface Hub 2S 85"

The Surface Hub 2S 85” uses a 600 x 600 VESA mount pattern. As shown in the following image, Microsoft has partnered with [Steelcase](https://www.steelcase.com/products/collaboration/steelcase-roam/) to create mounting options compatible with the Surface Hub 2S 85” unique design.
