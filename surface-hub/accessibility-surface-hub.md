# Adjust Ease of Access settings on Surface Hub

Microsoft Surface Hub has a variety of Ease of Access options. New in Windows 10 Team 2020 Update 2:

- Users can adjust Ease of Access settings for the duration of a  Surface Hub session. When the session ends, Ease of Access settings revert to their default state. 
- Users can close apps on Surface Hub by selecting the close button, in the top right corner of the app, just like they do in other versions of Windows 10. This removes the need to close apps by dragging them to the bottom of the Surface Hub display. 

## Default Ease of Acess settings

Admins can manage Ease of Access settings so they remain in effect across all user sessions. With the exception of Mouse settings, users can adjust the default behavior, as shown in the following table.  


| Ease of Access feature | Default settings  | Availability|
| --------------------- | ----------------- |-------------|
| Magnifier             | Off               |Admins & users|
| High contrast         | No theme selected |Admins & users|
| Closed captions       | Defaults selected for Font and Background and window |Admins & users|
| Keyboard              | **On-screen Keyboard**, **Sticky Keys**, **Toggle Keys**, and **Filter Keys** are all off. |Admins & users|
| Mouse                 | Defaults selected for **Pointer size**, **Pointer color** and **Mouse keys**. |Admins only|
| Other options         | Defaults selected for **Visual options** and **Touch feedback**. |Admins & users|
