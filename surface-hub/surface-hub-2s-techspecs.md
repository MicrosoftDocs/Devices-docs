> <sup>1</sup> System software uses significant storage space. Available storage is subject to change based on system software updates and apps usage. 1 GB= 1 billion bytes. See Surface.com/Storage for more details. <br> <sup>2</sup> Doppler sensor not available in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, India, Kuwait, and Oman  due to local regulations.

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Hub can be used continuously for a maximum of 18 hours a day. To optimize for efficiency, Surface Hub uses smart sensors to turn off the LED screen when presence is no longer detected, which means there is no need to power it down at the end of the day. If the unit is installed in a 24-hour workplace environment, the sensors can be disabled to comply with the 18 hour per day maximum use recommendation. Note that prolonged display of a video signal may cause burned-in or image retention to occur on the screen. To learn more about managing power settings, see:
