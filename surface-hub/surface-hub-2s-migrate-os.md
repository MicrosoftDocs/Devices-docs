1. When the out-of-box experience (OOBE) setup starts, follow the instructions to install Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise (version *20H2* or later).

### Install Surface Hub 2S drivers and firmware

To ensure that your Surface Hub 2S is up to date, install [drivers and firmware for Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=101974). Then, reboot the device. Keep the Surface turned on for an hour, then reboot it again. You won't be prompted for the second reboot. This pause and extra reboot ensures that the firmware has been fully updated.

## Configure recommended settings

To configure Surface Hub 2S as a personal productivity device, see [Configure Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise on Surface Hub 2S](surface-hub-2-post-install.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't successfully migrate your device to Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise for Surface Hub 2S by following the steps outlined in this article, contact [Surface Hub Support](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4037644/surface-contact-surface-warranty-and-software-support).

### Manage SEMM enrollment

Enrolling a device into SEMM affects how you can manage it. For example, after you apply a SEMM package, all UEFI settings are unavailable (locked) in the device's UEFI menu. Default values for settings such as **IPv6 for PXE Boot** are also unavailable.

To change UEFI settings after you finish the migration, apply another SEMM package or unenroll the device from SEMM. If you apply another SEMM package to change the UEFI settings, you must use the original certificate when you build the new SEMM package. Use the UEFI Configurator tool and leave **EnableOSMigration** *off* (not *on* as in the original migration steps).

#### If you work with partners

If your company outsources the migration, you should have the partner transfer the SEMM certificate, SEMM package, and UEFI password to you. Or, after you migrate the Hub, you can immediately unenroll it from SEMM. This step enables the local administration of UEFI to transfer the device to another party. But we strongly recommend using a UEFI password, which can be configured after migration. To learn more, see [Manage Surface UEFI settings](/surface/manage-surface-uefi-settings).

#### To roll back to Windows 10 Team

If you choose to restore your device to Windows 10 Team after the migration, we recommend that you first unenroll Hub from SEMM. To learn more, see [Unenroll Surface devices from SEMM](/surface/unenroll-surface-devices-from-semm).

>[!WARNING]
>To unenroll a device from SEMM and restore user control of Surface UEFI settings, you must have the SEMM certificate used to enroll the device in SEMM. If this certificate becomes lost or corrupted, it is not possible to unenroll from SEMM. Back up and protect your SEMM certificate accordingly.

To restore your device to Windows 10 Team, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](surface-hub-recover-reset.md). Before you roll back to Windows 10 Team, we recommend that you first unenroll the Surface Hub from SEMM. To learn more, see [Unenroll Surface devices from SEMM](/surface/unenroll-surface-devices-from-semm).
