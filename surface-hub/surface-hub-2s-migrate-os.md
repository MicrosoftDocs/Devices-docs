#### General guidance

- Enrolling in SEMM locks all UEFI settings. To modify UEFI settings post-migration, either apply another SEMM package using the original certificate, or unenroll from SEMM.

#### Partner involvement

- If outsourcing migration, ensure the transfer of the SEMM certificate, SEMM package, and UEFI password for management continuity.
- To enable local UEFI administration after migration, consider unenrolling the device from SEMM immediately.

#### Rolling back to Windows 10 Team

- If you choose to restore your device to Windows 10 Team, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](surface-hub-recover-reset.md).
- Before you roll back to Windows 10 Team, we recommend that you first unenroll the Surface Hub from SEMM. To learn more, see [Unenroll Surface devices from SEMM](/surface/unenroll-surface-devices-from-semm).

> [!WARNING]
> Unenrolling from SEMM requires the original SEMM certificate. Loss or corruption of this certificate makes unenrollment impossible. Always back up and protect your SEMM certificate.
