# Manage EU privacy settings on Surface Hub

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) (GDPR), took effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents.

Surface Hub customers concerned about privacy under the new GDPR regulations can manage their device privacy with the following options that are provided by Microsoft:

- **Option 1:** Surface Hub devices in regions enforcing GDPR regulations automatically reduce diagnostic data emission to basic. Customers opting to provide a higher level of diagnostic data can use the Surface Hub Settings application or Mobile Device Management to override the default basic setting.

- **Option 2:** Surface Hub customers who want to remove any existing diagnostic data can download the [**Surface Hub Delete Diagnostic Data**](https://www.microsoft.com/p/surface-hub-delete-diagnostic-data/9mtxh9zl7mxs) application from the Microsoft Store. This app will allow customers to request deletion of associated diagnostic data directly from their Surface Hub device.

Microsoft has extensive expertise in protecting data, championing privacy, and complying with complex regulations, and currently complies with both EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and EU Model Clauses. We believe that the GDPR is an important step forward for clarifying and enabling individual privacy rights. We want to help you focus on your core business while efficiently preparing for the GDPR.
