# Manage EU privacy settings on Surface Hub

In May 2018, a European privacy law, the [General Data Protection Regulation](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) (GDPR), took effect. The GDPR includes rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data tied to EU residents.

Surface Hub customers concerned about privacy under GDPR regulations can manage their device privacy with the following options that are provided by Microsoft:

- **Option 1:** Surface Hub devices in regions enforcing GDPR regulations automatically reduce diagnostic data emission to basic. Customers opting to provide a higher level of diagnostic data can use the Surface Hub Settings app or Mobile Device Management to override the default basic setting.

- **Option 2:** Surface Hub customers who want to remove any existing diagnostic data can download the [**Surface Hub Delete Diagnostic Data**](https://www.microsoft.com/p/surface-hub-delete-diagnostic-data/9mtxh9zl7mxs) app from the Microsoft Store. This app allows customers to directly delete associated diagnostic data from their Surface Hub device.
