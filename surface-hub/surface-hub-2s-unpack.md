3. In the base of the Surface Hub 2S, open the accessories box containing the setup guide, Surface Hub Pen, Surface Hub 2 camera, and the power cable.
4. On the back of the surface hub, there's an instructional label that shows you where to attach the mounting hardware. Install them in place and remove the label.
5. If you're using a mobile stand remember to lock the wheels to keep the stand in place
6. Be sure to lift the Surface Hub 2S with both hands and support the bottom of the device.
