## Mounting Surface Hub 3 85"

The Surface Hub 3 85" uses a 600 x 600 VESA mount pattern. As shown in the following image, Microsoft has partnered with [Steelcase](https://www.steelcase.com/products/collaboration/steelcase-roam/) to create mounting options compatible with the Surface Hub 3 85" unique design.

### Mounting dimensions

If using other (non-Steelcase) mounting options, you will need spacers to account for the compute enclosure on the back of the device. Spacers and other certified accessories are available from [Salamander Designs](http://www.salamandercommercial.com/surface-hub-2).

> [!WARNING]
> **Unseen hazards in walls or other mounting surfaces** <br>
Walls and other mounting surfaces may contain electrical wires, gas lines, and other unseen hazards or obstacles. Cutting or drilling into an unseen hazard may cause serious personal injury or death.
It is the installer's responsibility to locate unseen hazards before and to avoid these hazards during installation. Assess the mounting environment and ensure there are no unseen hazards in the wall or other mounting surfaces before drilling or cutting.

> [!WARNING]
