# Surface Hub update history

Windows was designed to be a service, which means it automatically gets better through periodic software updates. Typically you don’t have to do anything to get the latest Windows 10 updates—they'll download and install whenever they’re available.

Most Windows updates focus on performance and security improvements. In the list below, the most recent Windows update with Surface Hub-specific improvements is listed first. Updates are cumulative, so installing the latest available Windows update (even if it isn't on the list below) ensures that you also benefit from improvements in any previous updates. Microsoft Store apps are updated through the Microsoft Store (managed by the Surface Hub's system administrator). Details about app updates are provided on a per-app basis.
