# What's new for Surface Hub 3

Surface Hub 3, available in 50-inch and 85-inch models, delivers an inclusive hybrid collaboration experience through the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Designed end-to-end by Microsoft, Surface Hub 3 is the [premier all-in-one hybrid meeting and collaboration device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxasUd908k&t=1s) built for modern work. It brings advanced features such as **AI-powered interactive experiences**, **speaker recognition**, and **Team Copilot**, creating an engaging and efficient environment for hybrid teams.

There are several ways to get the new Surface Hub experience:

- Purchase a new Surface Hub 3 from a [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS).
- Upgrade from Surface Hub 2S to Surface Hub 3 via the [Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge](surface-hub-3-compute-cartridge-faq.md), delivering faster performance and enhanced graphics.
- Migrate your Surface Hub 2S to the new experience following the instructions in [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

## Hybrid meetings that include everyone

Dissolve boundaries for hybrid teams with a device designed to make meetings more inclusive. Surface Hub 3 provides a premium, AI-powered experience certified for Microsoft Teams. Users can seamlessly join meetings across different platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Google Meet.

- **Surface Hub Smart Camera** offers remote participants the best possible view of the room.  
  - AI-powered automatic framing keeps participants in view even when they move or interact with content.
  - Ultra-wide 136-degree field of view with high-quality glass optics and a low-light sensor.
- **One-touch join**: Join Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Webex meetings with a single tap on the home screen.
- **Facial expressions and body language** are vividly rendered on the 4K touchscreen display, delivering a more natural and inclusive experience for remote and in-room participants.

### AI-powered speaker recognition and Copilot

Surface Hub 3 takes collaboration to the next level with **AI-powered speaker recognition** and **Team Copilot**. These features enhance hybrid meetings, ensuring that everyone’s contributions are recognized and tracked. Background noise is suppressed, making meetings easier to follow and ensuring each speaker's contributions are clearly heard.

- **Speaker recognition**: Identifies each participant’s voice in the room, analyzing vocal characteristics like pitch and tone to create a unique voiceprint. This ensures individual contributions are recognized during the meeting, allowing for more accurate meeting recaps.

  - **Voice enrollment**: End users can easily create a voice profile via [aka.ms/voiceprofile](https://aka.ms/voiceprofile), allowing their voice to be recognized in meetings. 
  - **IT administration:** Admins can manage voice and face enrollment for specific users, groups of users, or an entire organization. To learn more, see [Overview of voice and face enrollment](/microsoftteams/rooms/voice-and-face-recognition).

- **Copilot in Teams**: With **Team Copilot**, meetings become smarter and more efficient. Copilot attributes notes to each speaker and generates real-time insights and follow-up tasks, eliminating the need for post-meeting transcription.
  - Copilot works in real time, ensuring participants in the room are correctly attributed in meeting notes.
  - **Seamless integration**: Team Copilot can take live notes without needing a Teams call or transcription, making it useful even for in-person meetings.

    Without **speaker recognition**, audio in hybrid meetings is typically attributed to the room as a whole, making it difficult to identify individual contributions. With **speaker recognition**, contributions are accurately assigned to each speaker, ensuring meeting notes are more actionable.

**Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, following strict privacy guidelines, including GDPR compliance. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

- **Microsoft Whiteboard**: Empower everyone to contribute during brainstorms with active dual-pen inking, which delivers a natural "pen-to-paper" experience. Fast, fluid responsiveness makes inking intuitive, and participants can collaborate from their PCs, phones, or tablets.
- **Teams Cast**: Share content wirelessly from a PC to Surface Hub 3 with Microsoft Teams Cast, making it easier for everyone to stay engaged during meetings. To learn more, see [Cast content from your desktop to a Microsoft Teams Room](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d).

## Surface Hub platform differences

We understand that transitioning operating systems introduces change management considerations. Many customers ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition on Surface Hub 2S and the new [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform](/microsoftteams/rooms/). This new platform, which powers Surface Hub 3 and is available through the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge, provides a modern, secure, and integrated Teams Rooms experience designed for hybrid collaboration.

### Overview of key differences

| **Feature**                                  | **Surface Hub 2S running Windows 10 Team Edition** | **Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows**   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supports a range of applications outside of Teams, including Microsoft Edge and apps from the Microsoft Store.                                      | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform focuses on streamlining the meeting experience. While it does not support external apps such as Microsoft Edge directly on the device, users can easily share content from their personal devices using Desktop Sharing or [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) during meetings. For native app support, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to apps. |
| **Access to personal files & login**         | Users can log in to access their personal files and create a personalized experience.                                        | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform prioritizes shared use in meeting spaces Users can connect their personal devices and wirelessly share content during meetings through Desktop Sharing or [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d). |
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires sign-in to access the Whiteboard, and all content is tied to the signed-in account.                             | The new platform simplifies Whiteboard access—no sign-in is required. Whiteboards are automatically saved to OneDrive when a Work or School account joins the meeting. This approach enhances collaboration while maintaining security, as Surface Hub does not retain access after the meeting ends. The Whiteboard can also be pre-attached or switched during meetings for added flexibility. |
| **HDMI Ingest**                              | HDMI Ingest allows users to project their device screens via an HDMI cable.                                          | HDMI Ingest functionality is streamlined in the Teams Rooms experience. Although direct HDMI Ingest is currently unavailable, users can easily switch Surface Hub into HDMI or USB-C bypass mode using the onboard ports. This allows the device to be used as an external monitor when needed, ensuring flexibility. |
| **Wireless screen sharing**                                 | Supports wireless screen sharing via Miracast for quick content projection.                                         | Supports wireless screen sharing via [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) for a more consistent, unified sharing experience within Teams, helping users maintain a smooth workflow. |
| **DisplayPort video-out**                    | Provides DisplayPort video out for connecting to external displays.                                         | DisplayPort video out is not supported natively in the Teams Rooms environment. However, users who require this functionality can migrate to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md), enabling access to DisplayPort for presentations and extended display needs. |
| **Security**                        | Supports automatic password rotation for the device account (resource account), enhancing security.                                         | Supports Conditional Access -  we recommend setting the password for the resource account to never expire and implementing [Conditional Access and Intune compliance for Microsoft Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices) to control sign-in processes in shared spaces, ensuring compliance and protection. |

### Surface Hub 2S on Windows 10 Team edition

Windows 10 Team edition, the legacy OS that was the default on Surface Hub 2S, remains supported until October 14, 2025, allowing time for customers to transition their Surface Hub 2S devices to the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Customers can choose to upgrade their Surface Hub 2S devices with the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge, which effectively turns their Hub devices into a Surface Hub 3. Or customers can use the [software migration option](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) to transition to Teams Rooms on Windows, although without access to capabilities like Smart Rotation, Portrait, Intelligent Audio<sup>1</sup>, and faster performance, which all require Surface Hub 3 hardware. To learn more, see [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

You can software-migrate your Surface Hub 2S device for free at any time before the end of support on October 14, 2025. Unlike the standard versions of Windows 10, there's no extended support option for Windows 10 Team edition when support ends.
