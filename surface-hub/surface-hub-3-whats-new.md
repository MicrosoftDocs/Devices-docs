### AI-powered speaker recognition

Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows introduces **AI-powered speaker recognition**, enhancing the meeting experience by identifying individual voices in the room (for participants who have opted in through voice enrollment). With clear consent and privacy in mind, this feature ensures that meeting contributions are accurately attributed to each speaker, supporting better follow-up and collaboration. Background noise is suppressed, creating a clearer, more focused environment for all participants.

- **Speaker recognition**: Identifies participants' voices in the room by analyzing vocal characteristics, ensuring individual contributions are tracked. 
  - **Voice enrollment**: End users can easily create a voice profile via [aka.ms/voiceprofile](https://aka.ms/voiceprofile), allowing their voice to be recognized in meetings. 
  - **IT administration**: Admins can manage voice and face enrollment for specific users, groups of users, or an entire organization, ensuring secure and accurate identification. To learn more, see [Overview of voice and face enrollment](/microsoftteams/rooms/voice-and-face-recognition).

- **Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, adhering to strict privacy guidelines and regulatory requirements for data protection. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

## Surface Hub platform differences

For customers with Surface Hub v1 or Surface Hub 2S devices that have used the legacy Windows 10 Team edition experience previously in their organization, we understand that transitioning operating systems to the new Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform introduces change management considerations. Many customers ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition on Surface Hub 2S and the new [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform](/microsoftteams/rooms/). This new platform provides a modern, secure, and integrated Teams Rooms experience designed for hybrid collaboration. It powers new Surface Hub 3 devices, Surface Hub 2S devices upgraded with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge**, as well as Surface Hub 2S devices that have been software-migrated from the legacy OS, to the new platform.

| **Teams Admin Center integration**           | Limited to traditional device management tools. | Full integration with the **Microsoft Teams Admin Center** and **Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal**, allowing IT admins to remotely monitor, manage, and configure devices in real time from anywhere. |

Any new hardware-dependent features will also be supported as applicable. . |
| **Low-touch deployment**                     | Standard deployment processes. | **Windows Autopilot** enables low-touch deployment for Surface Hub, allowing rapid configuration and integration into your environment with minimal IT overhead. This feature is exclusive to Teams Rooms on Windows. |
| **Security**                        | Supports automatic password rotation for the device account (resource account).                                         | Supports Conditional Access -  we recommend setting the password for the resource account to never expire and implementing [Conditional Access and Intune compliance for Microsoft Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices) to control sign-in processes in shared spaces, ensuring compliance and protection. |
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supports a range of applications outside of Teams, including Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Edge and third-party apps from the Microsoft Store.                                      | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform focuses on streamlining the meeting experience.

For users needing constant access to personal content on Surface Hubs, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to personal content within perpetually signed-in app experiences.|
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires sign-in to access the Whiteboard, and all content is tied to the signed-in account.                             | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform simplifies Whiteboard access—no sign-in is required. Whiteboards are automatically saved to OneDrive when a user with a Work or School account from the same organization joins the meeting. This approach enhances collaboration while maintaining security, as Surface Hub does not retain access after the meeting ends. Whiteboards can also be pre-attached or switched during meetings for added flexibility. |
| **Escalate ad-hoc whiteboard to meeting and retain in meeting stage**               | Separate from the Teams meeting, required sharing a link or sharing from within the Whiteboard app for collaborators on Teams to open in a separate window.                                                                 | Ad-hoc whiteboards are seamlessly retained in the Teams meeting stage after escalating to a meeting and adding remote participants, ensuring context is preserved and providing a more streamlined, seamless collaboration experience. |

Although direct HDMI Ingest to the Teams Rooms experience is not supported on Surface Hub, users can easily switch Surface Hub into HDMI or USB-C bypass mode using the onboard ports. This allows the device to be used as an external monitor when needed, ensuring flexibility. Customers can also use Teams Cast to wirelessly share screen content to Surface Hub running the Teams Rooms experience. |
| **Wireless screen sharing**                                 | Supports wireless screen sharing into the dedicated Connect application via Miracast for quick content projection.                                         | Supports wireless screen sharing via [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d), available for seamless content sharing, whether or not a meeting is in session. This facilitates a more consistent, unified sharing experience within Teams or improvised collaboration. |
| **DisplayPort video-out**                    | Provides DisplayPort video out for connecting to external displays.                                         | DisplayPort video out (extend or duplicate) is not supported natively in the Teams Rooms environment on Surface Hub. However, users who require this functionality can migrate to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md), enabling access to DisplayPort for presentations and extended display needs. |

### Surface Hub 2S on Windows 10 Team edition

Windows 10 Team edition, the legacy OS that was the default on Surface Hub 2S, remains supported until October 14, 2025, allowing time for customers to transition their Surface Hub 2S devices to the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Customers can choose to upgrade their Surface Hub 2S devices with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge**, which effectively turns their Hub devices into a Surface Hub 3. Or customers can use the [software migration option](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) to transition to Teams Rooms on Windows, although without access to capabilities like Smart Rotation, Portrait, Intelligent Audio<sup>2</sup>, and faster performance (which all require Surface Hub 3 hardware). To learn more, see [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can software-migrate your Surface Hub 2S device for free at any time before the end of support on October 14, 2025. Unlike the standard versions of Windows 10, there's no extended support option for Windows 10 Team edition when support ends.
