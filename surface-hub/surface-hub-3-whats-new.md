# What's new for Surface Hub 3

Surface Hub 3, available in 50-inch and 85-inch models, delivers an inclusive hybrid collaboration experience through the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Designed end-to-end by Microsoft, Surface Hub 3 is the [premier all-in-one hybrid meeting and collaboration device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHxasUd908k&t=1s) built for modern work. It brings advanced features such as **AI-powered interactive experiences**, **speaker recognition**, and **Team Copilot**, creating an engaging and efficient environment for hybrid teams.

There are several ways to get the new Surface Hub experience:

- Purchase a new Surface Hub 3 from a [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS) (available December 5, 2023).
- Upgrade from Surface Hub 2S to Surface Hub 3 via the [Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge](surface-hub-3-compute-cartridge-faq.md), delivering faster performance and enhanced graphics.
- Migrate your Surface Hub 2S to the new experience following the instructions in [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

## Hybrid meetings that include everyone

Dissolve boundaries for hybrid teams with a device designed to make meetings more inclusive. Surface Hub 3 provides a premium, AI-powered experience certified for Microsoft Teams. Users can seamlessly join meetings across different platforms like Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Google Meet.

- **Surface Hub Smart Camera** offers remote participants the best possible view of the room.  
  - AI-powered automatic framing keeps participants in view even when they move or interact with content.
  - Ultra-wide 136-degree field of view with high-quality glass optics and a low-light sensor.
- **One-touch join**: Join Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Webex meetings with a single tap on the home screen.
- **Facial expressions and body language** are vividly rendered on the 4K touchscreen display, delivering a more natural and inclusive experience for remote and in-room participants.

### AI-powered speaker recognition and Copilot

Surface Hub 3 takes collaboration to the next level with **AI-powered speaker recognition** and **Team Copilot**. These features enhance hybrid meetings, ensuring that everyone’s contributions are recognized and tracked.

- **Speaker recognition**: Identifies each participant’s voice in the room, analyzing vocal characteristics like pitch and tone to create a unique voiceprint. This ensures individual contributions are recognized during the meeting, allowing for more accurate meeting recaps.
  - **Voice enrollment**: End users can easily create a voice profile via [aka.ms/voiceprofile](https://aka.ms/voiceprofile), allowing their voice to be recognized in meetings.
  - **Noise isolation**: Background noise is suppressed, making meetings easier to follow and ensuring each speaker's contributions are clearly heard.
- **Copilot in Teams**: With **Team Copilot**, meetings become smarter and more efficient. Copilot attributes notes to each speaker and generates real-time insights and follow-up tasks, eliminating the need for post-meeting transcription.
  - Copilot works in real time, ensuring participants in the room are correctly attributed in meeting notes.
  - **Seamless integration**: Team Copilot can take live notes without needing a Teams call or transcription, making it useful even for in-person meetings.

    Without **speaker recognition**, audio in hybrid meetings is typically attributed to the room as a whole, making it difficult to identify individual contributions. With **speaker recognition**, contributions are accurately assigned to each speaker, ensuring meeting notes are more actionable.

**Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, following strict privacy guidelines, including GDPR compliance. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

## Manage remotely and stay secure anywhere

Surface Hub 3 empowers IT administrators with enterprise-grade tools to manage devices and maintain security from anywhere.

- **Remote management**: Use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to configure settings and policies. Monitor health and room status with Microsoft Teams Admin Center and the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal.
- **Low-touch deployment**: Quickly deploy devices using Windows Autopilot, and leverage auto-login capabilities for seamless integration with Azure Directory.
- **Security and compliance**: Ensure data protection with BitLocker, Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM), and Microsoft Defender for cloud-powered security. Enable Conditional Access policies to safeguard sign-ins on shared devices.

## Make any place a teamwork space

Surface Hub 3 offers unmatched versatility with modular and adaptable components that evolve with your space needs. Whether your teams meet in large conference rooms or smaller breakout areas, Surface Hub 3 delivers the right fit.

- **Two size options**: The 85-inch model is perfect for large rooms, while the 50-inch model suits smaller spaces. Both models support Smart Rotation for effortless collaboration in landscape or portrait mode.
- **Mobile adaptability**: Easily move your Surface Hub 3 using electric lift mobile stands from Salamander Designs. Take it further with the **APC™ Charge Mobile Battery**, offering portability without needing a constant power supply.
- **Modular design**: Interchangeable components, such as the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge, ensure your device is future-proof, adapting to both technology advancements and changing room configurations.

## Seamlessly share and co-create together

Surface Hub 3 enables real-time collaboration and co-creation, no matter where participants are located.

- **Microsoft Whiteboard**: Empower everyone to contribute during brainstorms with active dual-pen inking, which delivers a natural "pen-to-paper" experience. Fast, fluid responsiveness makes inking intuitive, and participants can collaborate from their PCs, phones, or tablets.
- **Teams Cast**: Share content wirelessly from a PC to Surface Hub 3 with Microsoft Teams Cast, making it easier for everyone to stay engaged during meetings.
- **AI-powered experiences**: Surface Hub 3 introduces **speaker recognition**, which works with **Team Copilot** to attribute meeting notes to individual speakers, capture insights, and generate follow-up tasks automatically.

## Surface Hub platform differences

We understand that transitioning operating systems introduces change management considerations. Many customers often ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition supported on Surface Hub 2S and the new Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform. This new platform ships with Surface Hub 3 devices and the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge and is available via software migration for existing Surface Hub 2S devices.

### Overview of key differences

| Feature                                  | Surface Hub 2S running Windows 10 Team Edition      | Surface Hub 3 running Teams Rooms on Windows        |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supports applications outside of the Teams environment. Users can access the Microsoft Store, Microsoft Edge browser, and install or use native apps directly on the device. | Does not support apps outside of the Teams experience. For Microsoft Edge or other native apps, users need to connect their own device and share the screen via Teams Cast or Desktop Sharing during meetings. Alternatively, migrating the Hub to Windows 11 Pro/Enterprise enables full app access. |
| **Access to personal files & login**         | Users can log in and access their personal files, providing a more personalized experience. | No direct access to personal files or user sign-in. Users should use their own devices and share files or screens via Desktop Sharing or Teams Cast during a meeting. |
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires users to sign in to access the Whiteboard feature. The Whiteboard content is tied to the account used during the meeting. | No sign-in required to access Whiteboard during meetings. When a user with a Work or School account joins a meeting with Whiteboard, it's automatically saved to OneDrive. If multiple users are involved, the Whiteboard is saved to the meeting organizer’s OneDrive. After the meeting ends, online participants retain access. |
| **HDMI Ingest**                              | HDMI Ingest allows users to project their device screens via an HDMI cable directly into the Teams experience on the Surface Hub. | HDMI Ingest is unavailable, but users can use the HDMI or USB-C port to switch the Hub into an external monitor mode using the physical mode selector button on the display. This mode bypasses the Teams Rooms environment. |
| **Miracast**                                 | Supports wireless screen sharing via Miracast, allowing users to project their screen wirelessly without the need for cables. | Miracast is not supported. Users must use Teams Cast to share their screen wirelessly during an active Teams meeting. This ensures integration within the Teams platform for a consistent experience. |
| **DisplayPort video-out**                    | Includes support for DisplayPort video out, allowing users to connect the Hub to external displays for presentations or extended display options. | DisplayPort video out is not supported. To regain this functionality, users can migrate to Windows 11 Pro/Enterprise, turning the Hub into a standard Windows PC with full display capabilities. |
| **Password rotation**                        | Offers automatic password rotation for the device account (resource account), ensuring periodic password changes to improve security. | Password rotation is not supported. It's recommended to set the resource account's password to never expire. For added security, administrators can implement Conditional Access policies to ensure only compliant devices can sign in to shared device accounts. |


### Overview of key differences option 2

| Feature                                  | Surface Hub 2S running Windows 10 Team Edition | Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows   |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supported                                          | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform doesn't support applications outside of the Teams experience. For example, native Microsoft Edge browser access isn't currently possible on Surface Hub 3 or software-migrated Surface Hub 2S devices running the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. We recommend using your own PC or mobile device and taking advantage of Desktop Sharing during an active Teams meeting or using Teams Cast to wirelessly share screen content, including any open Edge pages, from your device. Alternatively, if you need to run native apps, you can [transition Surface Hub 3](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) or [Surface Hub 2S devices](surface-hub-2s-migrate-os.md) to Windows 11 Pro/Enterprise. As a Windows 11 device, it can run applications just like any other Windows 11 PC.|
| **Access to personal files & login**         | Supported                                          |  Access to personal files or sign-in is currently unavailable on Surface Hub 3 or software-migrated Surface Hub 2S devices running the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. We recommend using your own PC or mobile device and taking advantage of Desktop Sharing during an active Teams meeting or [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) to wirelessly share screen content (including any open Microsoft Edge pages) from your device. |
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires sign-in                                   | On Surface Hub 3 or software-migrated Surface Hub 2S devices running the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform, you no longer need to sign in to access the Whiteboard. When your Work or School account joins a meeting with an active Whiteboard, it is automatically saved to your OneDrive. If a new Whiteboard is started from Surface Hub during a meeting with multiple users, it will be saved to the meeting organizer’s OneDrive. After the meeting ends, all online participants still have access to the Whiteboard; however, the Surface Hub itself does not retain access for security reasons.  Additionally, users can now attach a new or existing Whiteboard to a Teams meeting within the Teams desktop application. Participants in the active meeting can select **Share > Whiteboard** to view the preattached Whiteboard, provided that at least one person with a Work or School account is present to grant the Surface Hub permission. If necessary, online meeting participants other than the Surface Hub can select a different Whiteboard to load into the meeting by selecting **Home**.|
| **HDMI Ingest**                              | Supported                                          | HDMI Ingest, the ability to project your device screen via HDMI cable directly into the Teams Rooms experience on Surface Hub, is currently unavailable. Customers can, however, use Surface Hub 2S or Surface Hub 3 as an external monitor and connect via the onboard HDMI port (or USB-C port next to it), and switch from the Teams Rooms on Windows experience to HDMI or USB-C bypass mode using the physical mode selector button on the bottom right of the Surface Hub display. |
| **Miracast**                                 | Supported                                          | Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows doesn't support Miracast, unlike the previous Surface Hub 2S running Windows 10 Team edition. However, you can still mirror your device by using Teams Cast during an active Teams meeting, ensuring seamless and efficient screen sharing without the need for Miracast. This approach integrates directly with Teams, providing a smooth and consistent user experience. |
| **DisplayPort video-out**                    | Supported                                          | Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows doesn't support DisplayPort video out. Users who require this functionality can [migrate Surface Hub 3](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) or [Surface Hub 2S devices](surface-hub-2s-migrate-os.md) to run Windows Pro or Enterprise. This transition of Surface Hub to a standard Windows PC enables the use of DisplayPort video out, ensuring continuity and access to necessary display capabilities for collaboration and presentations. |
| **Password rotation**                        | Supported                                          | Password rotation—a feature in Windows 10 Team edition to periodically change the password for the Surface Hub device account—isn't supported on the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. It's recommended to set the password for the device account, also known as the resource account, to never expire. You can use [Conditional Access policies](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices)<sup>1</sup> to secure the sign-in process on devices that are in shared spaces and used by multiple people, including Surface Hub. This ensures that only compliant devices can sign into device accounts, enhancing security and compliance. |


## Surface Hub 2S on Windows 10 Team edition

Windows 10 Team edition, the legacy OS that was the default on Surface Hub 2S, remains supported until October 14, 2025, allowing time for customers to transition their Surface Hub 2S devices to the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Customers can choose to upgrade their Surface Hub 2S devices with the Surface Hub 3 Pack, which effectively turns their Hub devices into a Surface Hub 3. Or customers can use the software migration option to transition to Teams Rooms on Windows, although without access to capabilities like Smart Rotation, Portrait, Intelligent Audio<sup>1</sup>, and faster performance, which all require Surface Hub 3 hardware. To learn more, see [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

You can software-migrate your Surface Hub 2S device for free at any time before the end of support on October 14, 2025. Unlike the standard versions of Windows 10, there's no extended support option for Windows 10 Team edition when support ends.
