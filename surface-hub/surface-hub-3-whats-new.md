- **Biometric privacy and security** are a top priority. Microsoft encrypts voice and face data at rest and in transit, adhering to strict privacy guidelines and regulatory requirements for data protection. Users can unenroll their voice profiles at any time, and profiles are automatically deleted if unused for one year.

## Surface Hub platform differences

For customers with Surface Hub 2S (or Surface Hub v1) devices that have used the legacy Windows 10 Team edition experience previously in their organization, we understand that transitioning operating systems to the new Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform introduces change management considerations. Many customers ask about the differences between the legacy Windows 10 Team edition on Surface Hub 2S and the new [Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows platform](/microsoftteams/rooms/). This new platform provides Surface Hub with a modern, secure, integrated, and consistent Teams Rooms experience designed for hybrid collaboration. It powers new Surface Hub 3 devices, Surface Hub 2S devices upgraded with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge,** and Surface Hub 2S devices that have been software-migrated from the legacy OS, to the new platform.

| **Persistent chat**                                                                 | Displays as fleeting chat bubbles with text previews.                                                   | Includes a persistent chat pane, consistent with other Teams Rooms on Windows devices, allowing for ongoing conversations throughout meetings.                                                                                                                           |

| **Teams Admin Center and Pro Management Portal integration**                        | Experience and capabilities are inconsistent with other Teams Rooms devices.                            | Fully integrated into the **Microsoft Teams Admin Center** and **Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal**, providing a consistent management experience with other Teams Rooms on Windows devices, enabling IT admins to remotely monitor, manage, and configure devices in real time. |
| **Digital Signage**                                                                 | Not supported.                                                                                           | Anticipated to become generally available in October 2024, digital signage is supported on Surface Hub consistent with other Teams Rooms on Windows devices.  Digital signage allows Teams Rooms devices to display custom content for signage purposes when not in active use. To learn more, see [Configure digital signage on Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms/digital-signage).                                                                                                                                             |
| **Access to all new Teams Rooms on Windows features**         | Limited updates and features tied to the Windows 10 Team OS, which reaches end of support on October 14, 2025. | Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows provides access to the latest Teams Rooms features and updates, including **AI-powered** capabilities and **speaker recognition** for enhanced hybrid collaboration. Any new hardware-dependent features will also be supported as applicable. |
| **Low-touch deployment**                     | Standard deployment processes. | **Windows Autopilot** enables low-touch deployment for Surface Hub, allowing rapid configuration and integration into your environment with minimal IT overhead. This feature is exclusive to Teams Rooms on Windows. |
| **Security**                        | Supports automatic password rotation for the device account (resource account).                                         | Supports Conditional Access -  we recommend setting the password for the resource account to never expire and implementing [Conditional Access and Intune compliance for Microsoft Teams Rooms](/microsoftteams/rooms/conditional-access-and-compliance-for-devices) to control sign-in processes in shared spaces, ensuring compliance and protection. |
| **Microsoft Store, Edge browser & native apps** | Supports a range of applications outside of Teams, including Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Edge and third-party apps from the Microsoft Store.                                      | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform focuses on streamlining the meeting experience. While it doesn't support additional apps such as Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Edge, or third-party apps directly on the device, users can easily share content from these apps running on their personal devices using [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings. For more app experiences, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to apps. |
| **Access to personal files & login**         | Users can log in to the Windows OS itself to access their personal meetings and files and create a personalized experience.                                        | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform prioritizes shared use in meeting spaces. Users can easily share content from these apps running on their personal devices using [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings. For users needing constant access to personal content on Surface Hubs, migrating to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md) enables full access to personal content within perpetually signed-in app experiences.|
| **Whiteboard sign-in**                       | Requires sign-in to access the Whiteboard, and all content is tied to the signed-in account.                             | The Teams Rooms on Windows platform simplifies Whiteboard access—no sign-in is required. Whiteboards are automatically saved to OneDrive when a user with a Work or School account from the same organization joins the meeting. This approach enhances collaboration while maintaining security, as Surface Hub doesn't retain access after the meeting ends. Whiteboards can also be preattached to the meeting or switched by non-Hub users during meetings for added flexibility. |
| **Escalate ad-hoc whiteboard to meeting and retain in meeting stage**               | Separate from the Teams meeting, requires sharing a link, or sharing from within the Whiteboard app for collaborators on Teams to open in a separate window.                                                                 | Ad-hoc whiteboards are seamlessly retained in the Teams meeting stage after escalating to a meeting and adding remote participants. This ensures that context is preserved and provides a streamlined, more seamless collaboration experience. |
| **HDMI Ingest**                              | HDMI Ingest allows users to project their device screens into the dedicated Connect application via an HDMI cable.                                          | Although direct HDMI Ingest to the Teams Rooms experience isn't supported on Surface Hub, users can easily switch Surface Hub into HDMI or USB-C bypass mode using the onboard ports. USB-C bypass mode allows Surface Hub to function as a standalone display when connected to an external device via the USB-C port, bypassing the Teams Rooms interface. Customers can also use [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d) or Desktop Sharing during meetings to wirelessly share screen content to Surface Hub running the Teams Rooms experience. |
| **Wireless screen sharing**                  | Supports wireless screen sharing into the dedicated Connect application via Miracast for quick content projection.                                          |Supports wireless screen sharing via [Teams Cast](https://support.microsoft.com/office/cast-content-from-your-desktop-to-a-microsoft-teams-room-6d62cdbb-3da2-4bb9-80bd-9cf1098beb3d), available for seamless content sharing even when a scheduled meeting is not in session. Desktop Sharing also provides an easy way to share content from personal devices during a scheduled or ad-hoc meeting. These options facilitate a more consistent, unified sharing experience within Teams or improvised collaboration.|
| **DisplayPort video out**                    | Provides DisplayPort video out for connecting to external displays.                                         | DisplayPort video out (extend or duplicate) isn't supported natively in the Teams Rooms environment on Surface Hub. However, users who require this functionality can migrate to [Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise](surface-hub-3-migrate-os.md), enabling access to DisplayPort for presentations and extended display needs. |

### Surface Hub 2S on Windows 10 Team edition

Windows 10 Team edition, the legacy OS that was the default on Surface Hub 2S, remains supported until October 14, 2025, allowing time for customers to transition their Surface Hub 2S devices to the Teams Rooms on Windows platform. Customers can choose to upgrade their Surface Hub 2S devices with the **Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge**, which effectively turns their Hub devices into a Surface Hub 3. Or customers can use the [software migration option](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) to transition to Teams Rooms on Windows, although without access to capabilities like Smart Rotation, Portrait, Intelligent Audio<sup>1</sup>, and faster performance (which all require Surface Hub 3 hardware). To learn more, see [Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can [software-migrate](surface-hub-2s-migrate-to-mtr-w.md) your Surface Hub 2S device for free using the seamless software-migration option at any time before the end of support on October 14, 2025. Unlike the standard versions of Windows 10, there's no extended support option for Windows 10 Team edition when support ends.
