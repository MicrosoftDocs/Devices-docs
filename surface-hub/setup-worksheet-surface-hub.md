# Setup worksheet (Surface Hub)

When you've finished pre-setup and are ready to start first-time setup for your Microsoft Surface Hub, make sure you have all the information listed in this section.

You should fill out one list for each Surface Hub you need to configure, although some information can be used on all Surface Hubs, like the proxy information or domain credentials. Some of this information may not be needed, depending on how you've decided to configure your device, or depending on how the environment is configured for your organization's infrastructure.

When finished, review [Post deployment checklist](#post-deployment-checklist) below.

## Device affiliation

Use Device affiliation to manage user access to the Settings app on Surface Hub. With the Windows 10 Team operating system (that runs on Surface Hub), only authorized users can adjust settings using the Settings app. Since choosing the affiliation can impact feature availability, plan appropriately to ensure that users can access features as intended.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set Device affiliation during the initial out-of-box experience (OOBE) setup. If you need to reset Device affiliation, you’ll have to repeat OOBE setup.

To join Azure AD, you will need valid user credentials.                                                              | admin1@contoso.com, #MyPassw0rd | [Admin group management](admin-group-management-for-surface-hub.md)                     |
| Non Global Admin accounts                                | For Surface Hub devices joined to Azure AD,  you can limit admin permissions to management of the Settings app on Surface Hub. This enables you to scope admin permissions for Surface Hub only and prevent potentially unwanted admin access an entire Azure AD domain. |                                 | [Configure non Global admin accounts on Surface Hub](surface-hub-2s-nonglobal-admin.md) |
