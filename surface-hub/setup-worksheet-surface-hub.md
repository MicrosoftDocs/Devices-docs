# Setup worksheet (Surface Hub)

When you've finished pre-setup and are ready to start first-time setup for your Microsoft Surface Hub, make sure you have all the information listed in this section.

You should fill out one list for each Surface Hub you need to configure, although some information can be used on all Surface Hubs, like the proxy information or domain credentials. Some of this information may not be needed, depending on how you've decided to configure your device, or depending on how the environment is configured for your organization's infrastructure.

When finished, review [Post deployment checklist](#post-deployment-checklist) below.

## Device affiliation

Use Device affiliation to manage user access to the Settings app on Surface Hub. With the Windows 10 Team operating system (that runs on Surface Hub), only authorized users can adjust settings using the Settings app. Since choosing the affiliation can impact feature availability, plan appropriately to ensure that users can access features as intended.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set Device affiliation during the initial out-of-box experience (OOBE) setup. If you need to reset Device affiliation, you’ll have to repeat OOBE setup.

| Microsoft Entra tenant user credentials (username and password) | If you decide to have people in your Microsoft Entra organization become admins on the device, then you'll need to join the Surface Hub to Microsoft Entra ID. To join it to Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need valid credentials for an account in the tenant.                                                               | admin1@contoso.com, #MyPassw0rd | [Admin group management](admin-group-management-for-surface-hub.md)                     |
| Non Global Admin accounts                                | For Surface Hub devices joined to Microsoft Entra ID,  you can limit admin permissions to management of the Settings app on Surface Hub. This permission confinement enables you to scope admin permissions for Surface Hub only and prevent potentially unwanted admin access an entire Microsoft Entra domain. |                                 | [Configure non-Global Admin accounts on Surface Hub](surface-hub-2s-nonglobal-admin.md) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role. To learn more, see the recommended guidance in [Configure non-Global Admin accounts on Surface Hub](surface-hub-2s-nonglobal-admin.md).

| Domain to join                                     | This is the domain you'll need to join so that a security group of your choice can be admins for the device. You may need the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).                                                                          | contoso (short name) OR contoso.corp.com (FQDN) |
| Domain account credentials (username and password) | A domain can't be joined unless you provide sufficient account credentials to join the domain. Once you provide a domain to join and credentials to join the domain, then a security group of your choice can change settings on the device. | admin1, #MyPassword                             |
| Admin security group alias                         | This is a security group in your Active Directory (AD); any members of this security group can change settings on the device.                                                                                                                | SurfaceHubAdmins                                |

### If you're using a local admin

| Property                                                | What this is used for                                                                                   | Example             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Local admin account credentials (username and password) | If you decide not to join an AD domain or Microsoft Entra ID, you can create a local admin account on the device. | admin1, #MyPassword |
