# What to do if the Connect app in Surface Hub exits unexpectedly

At times, a wired Connect session that is started from the Welcome screen by connecting a DisplayPort input will exit back to the Welcome screen after using the side keypad or the source button to cycle through all source inputs.

This is an issue in the Connect app and its default full-screen state. By changing the size of the app, or by selecting a DisplayPort input thumbnail in the Connect app, you can prevent input cycling from affecting the app.

The way to resolve this issue is to first launch the Connect app from the Welcome screen, and THEN connect a DisplayPort input. If the input is already connected, manually select the thumbnail.
