# Get started with Surface Hub running Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows

[!INCLUDE [Hub MTR Scope](includes/hub-mtr-scope.md)]

## New installs

New Surface Hub 3 devices and Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridges come preinstalled with the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience. Turn it on and follow the prompts for the first run startup experience. See [First-time setup for Surface Hub running Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](first-run-program-surface-hub-3.md) to learn more.

## Upgrade

If you have a Surface Hub 2S, you can upgrade to the new experience via the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge (formerly Surface Hub 3 Pack). See [Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge](install-manage-surface-hub-3-compute-cartridge.md) to learn more.

## IT management of Surface Hub running Teams Rooms on Windows 

In addition to Microsoft Intune and other mobile device management (MDM) providers, IT admins can manage Surface Hubs running Teams Rooms on Windows via the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/). Use tools like [Microsoft Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/core/understand/introduction), OMA-DM-based management tools, and [Windows Group Policy](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/manage-group-policy).

## Security considerations

Depending on your organization's security posture, you might consider implementing more security measures beyond the default experience of running Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows in a locked-down state. This strategy includes changing the default Administrator password (factory set to **sfb**), adding a UEFI password, and implementing appropriate physical security measures. To learn more, see [Security best practices for Surface Hubs running Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows](surface-hub-3-security.md).
