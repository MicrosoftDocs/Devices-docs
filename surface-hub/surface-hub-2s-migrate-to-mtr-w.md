# Migrate Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows

If you have a Surface Hub 2S, you can migrate it to run the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience and bring HD video, audio, and content sharing to meetings of all sizes, from small huddle areas to large conference rooms. This enables Surface Hub 2S devices to run the same Windows 11 software platform shipping on new Surface Hub 3 devices.

## Background

- Begin the migration process via the downloadable **Surface Hub 2S OS Migration Launcher - Microsoft Teams Rooms** app, which you can install directly on a Surface Hub 2S or remotely via Intune or other cloud management tools.

> [!NOTE]
> The Migration Launcher app is designed exclusively for Surface Hub 2S devices transitioning from the Windows 10 Team edition OS to the Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience. It triggers the migration process under specific [prerequisite conditions](#prerequisites) and has no other functionality or user interface.

### Migration Launcher app deletes OS and data

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not install the Migration Launcher app on Surface Hub 2S unless you are prepared for immediate migration to Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience.

- Migration completely removes the Windows 10 Team edition operating system that comes with Surface Hub 2S.
- By selecting to install the Migration Launcher app on a Surface Hub 2S and thereby initiate a software migration, you consent to the removal of the Windows 10 Team edition OS, including the uninstall and removal of accounts, data, and other current configurations.
- The Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience results in increased energy consumption on Surface Hub due to changes in sleep state and power management settings.
- This app does not affect first-generation Surface Hub models. The Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows experience is not supported on first-generation Surface Hubs (Surface Hub v1).
- The migration process involves downloading approximately 30 GB and requires a minimum amount of available storage on-system to create a temporary partition.

## Prerequisites

- <!--Ensure Surface Hub 2S is connected to the Internet and has the latest Windows Updates, including **Microsoft Corporation - System Hardware Update - 02/03/2024 or later.-->
- Ensure Surface Hub 2S is connected to the Internet and has the latest Windows Updates, including **Microsoft Corporation - System Hardware Update - 11/21/2023** 
- To get all the required updates, sign in with Admin credentials, go to **All apps > Settings** >**Update and Security** >**Windows Update**, and install all updates. 
- Repeat the update retrieval process until you have installed all the available updates.
- Once updated, confirm that the UEFI version is **699.845.768.0** or later. <!--To be replaced with Feb 3 UEFI version -->
- If you're unable to check for Windows updates locally (for example, in remote admin scenarios), you can verify the OS version via Microsoft Intune admin center or other mobile device management (MDM) solutions.
- You can also check by validating that Windows 10 [OS Build19045.3758](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-30-2023-kb5032278-os-build-19045-3758-preview-0ae14f06-577e-4eb3-8fcb-c722f3f9dc29) is present on the system. <!--To be replaced with later Win OS version (Feb 3) -->
- Confirm network access to required sites: ***.devices.microsoft.com and download.microsoft.com**.
- Validate that your network can handle a **30 GB download**.

## Surface Hub 3 Pack option

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, if you don't wish to migrate your Surface Hub 2S, you can purchase the [Surface Hub 3 Pack](surface-hub-3-pack-faq.md), which lets you swap out your existing cartridge and instantly convert your Surface Hub 2S to a Surface Hub 3. To learn more, see [Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Pack](install-manage-surface-hub-3-pack.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> Support for Windows 10 Team Edition OS on Surface Hub, based on Windows 10 version 22H2, is scheduled to end on October 14, 2025.

## Install Migration Launcher app to trigger a migration

Choose one of the following options:

- [Manually install Migration Launcher app on Surface Hub 2S](#manually-install-migration-launcher-app-on-surface-hub-2s). Designed for migrating individual Surface Hub 2S devices.
- [Remotely install Migration Launcher app via Intune.](#remotely-install-migration-launcher-app-via-intune) Designed for migrating multiple select Surface Hub 2S devices remotely.

### Manually install Migration Launcher app on Surface Hub 2S

1. Sign back in as admin. Go to **Surface Hub** > **Apps & features** > **Open Store**.
2. Search for **Surface Hub 2S OS Migration Launcher â€“ Microsoft Teams Rooms** and select **Get**.
![Screenshot of Surface Hub 2S OS Migration Launcher](images/surface-hub2s-migration-app-download.png)
3. To validate successful installation, select **All apps** and look for **Surface Hub 2S OS Migration Launcher**.
4. Once you see the Migration Launcher in the app list, the migration proceeds automatically upon restarting the Windows 10 Team edition OS. You can either manually restart Surface Hub 2S or wait until the system automatically restarts during the default nightly maintenance window.

> [!TIP]
> After this initial restart, do not interfere with the system; even though it may appear nothing is happening and you still see the same experienc old OS, the migration proceeds independently after completing all necessary backend processes (including downloading and unzipping the new Teams Rooms on Windows image).

5. Typical migration time is around **90** minutes from restart after installing the Migration Launcher app, but the length can vary depending on many characteristics, including customer network bandwidth and related factors.
6. When migration is complete, the device displays the Windows first-time setup program, aka Out of the Box Experience (OOBE). To learn more, see [First-time setup for Surface Hub 3](first-run-program-surface-hub-3.md).

### Remotely install Migration Launcher app via Intune

![Screenshot that shows creation of app](images/hub2s-migration-intune-app.png)

This may take a few minutes, depending on network connectivity or other factors. You can check the upload status under the Notifications tray.

### Monitor deployment

- After deploying, monitor the deployment status in Intune.
- Navigate to the app in Intune and check the Overview and Assignments tabs to see the status and details of the deployment. Ensure you're checking the Device context status, not the User.

> [!NOTE]
> Several factors contribute to how long it takes for the app to finish deployment and installation on the target devices, including device power/sleep state, sync cadence/status with Intune, and related factors. Continue to monitor Intune status for indications of successful app deployment.

- Once the app is deployed, the next restart initiates migration, which - in this remote deployment scenario - is likely to be the automatic restart as part of the nightly maintenance window. Similar to the manual app deployment scenario, the migration process typically takes about 90 minutes after this restart (but many factors can impact migration time, as explained earlier, with a test example exceeding 5 hours on a slower network). Customers must test and validate sequences relative to their unique infrastructure and management approaches.
- When migration is complete, the device displays the Windows first-time setup program, aka Out of the Box Experience (OOBE). To learn more, see [First-time setup for Surface Hub 3](first-run-program-surface-hub-3.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Quick checks

- Verify that Surface Hub 2S is fully updated and otherwise meets the prerequisites described earlier. To learn more, see [Troubleshoot Surface Hub not Updating](troubleshoot-surface-hub-not-updating.md)
- Ensure the Migration Launcher app has been installed on target Surface Hub 2S devices.
- Ensure the system has restarted after installing the Migration Launcher app.
- <!-- possible step to advise ensuring sleep is turned off -->

### Event logs

- If migration does not proceed after 24 hours, check system event logs for possible errors, including a potential issue related to available storage space.
- <!-- add event log steps -->

### Remote deployment via Intune

- If the Migration Launcher app fails to deploy, check any error messages in the Intune console.
- Verify that the Surface Hub 2S devices are correctly enrolled and online.
- Consider verifying whether another Store for Business offline-licensed application can be remotely deployed to Surface Hub 2S devices.
