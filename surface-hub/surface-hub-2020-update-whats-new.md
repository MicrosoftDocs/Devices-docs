# What's new in Windows 10 Team 2020 Update

Windows 10 Team 2020 Update brings major improvements to device deployment and manageability along with the latest Windows 10 features.

##  Deployment and manageability

- Modern authentication for cloud device accounts: Surface Hub supports Exchange Web Services (EWS) and Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) based authentication to connect to Exchange, allowing customers to deprecate the use of Basic authentication. For details, see [Modern authentication on Surface Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-modern-auth).
- More than 20 new and updated mobile device management (MDM) policies:       These policies give IT admins improved control over multiple device settings including: app updates from the Microsoft Store, wireless projection settings such as Miracast over infrastructure, network settings such as Quality-Of-Service and 802.1x wired authentication, and new privacy/GDPR related settings.

##  Azure Active Directory Joined devices

- Single sign-on (SSO) for Azure AD joined devices. When users sign in with their Microsoft 365 credentials to “My meetings and files”, their user credentials flow seamlessly from app to app – including Microsoft 365 experiences in the browser.
- Conditional access (CA) for Azure AD joined devices.        IT admins can deploy device-level security policies to their Azure AD joined Surface Hub to control access to organizational resources in accordance with corporate security and compliance requirements.
- Support for non-Global admins for Azure AD joined devices.        Customers can choose a more granular set of admins within their admin hierarchy to manage Surface Hub. For more information, see [Admin group management](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/admin-group-management-for-surface-hub).


## Additional features


- Support for the new Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Edge has been rebuilt for optimal compatibility performance, security and privacy. To learn more, see [Install and configure the new Microsoft Edge on Surface Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-install-chromium-edge).
- Deploy Microsoft Teams faster           Microsoft Teams is included as the default Meetings, calling and collaboration app on new Surface Hub devices which can be changed or configured via MDM or directly on Surface Hub using the Settings app. To learn more, see [Deploy Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-surface-hub).
- Support for Proximity Join with Microsoft Teams  Proximity Join enables users to take scheduled Microsoft Teams calls on a nearby Surface Hub using their laptop/phone, or seamlessly transition an in-progress meeting to a nearby Surface Hub. Windows 10 Team 2020 Update adds Mobile Device Management (MDM) support to configure Proximity Join, and the feature will be subsequently released as a Microsoft Teams update through Microsoft Store.
- Support for Coordinated Meetings with Microsoft Teams In meeting rooms that feature a Surface Hub and a Microsoft Teams Room device, or spaces with two Surface Hub devices, Coordinated Meetings enable users to easily leverage both devices during a Microsoft Teams meeting. With a single tap, users can join a meeting from either device and maximize screen real estate by showing video feeds on one device, and a digital whiteboard or content on the other. Windows 10 Team 2020 Update adds Mobile Device Management (MDM) support to configure Coordinated Meetings, and the feature will be subsequently released as a Microsoft Teams update through Microsoft Store.
- Passwordless sign-in using FIDO2 security keys      Using FIDO2 security keys, customers can quickly and easily sign into Surface Hub without having to type in usernames and passwords. Combined with Single Sign-On (SSO), this feature provides fast and seamless authentication to files, apps, and websites during a meeting. To learn more, see [Configure passwordless sign-in on Surface Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-phone-authenticate).
- Improvements to passwordless sign-in using Microsoft Authenticator     For organizations that use Azure AD, users can use the Microsoft Authenticator app to sign in without having to type in usernames and passwords. Additionally, users can sign-in using their preferred email aliases in Azure AD in addition to their User Principal Name (UPN). To learn more, see [Sign in to Surface Hub with Microsoft Authenticator](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-authenticator-app).
- Dual-pen inking on Surface Hub 2S   Users can whiteboard and collaborate side-by-side on Surface Hub 2S using two Surface Hub 2 Pens. The firmware updates required to enable dual-pen inking will be released with a subsequent update.
