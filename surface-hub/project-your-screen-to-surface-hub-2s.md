## Share your screen wirelessly

If you have a PC that’s running Windows 8 or later, on your PC, press <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to connect wirelessly. Find the name of the Surface Hub you want to project to in the connect panel and select it to connect.

You can find the name of the Surface Hub in the bottom left corner of the screen, or when you press **Connect** :::image type="icon" source="images/project-your-screen-to-surface-hub-2s/connectapp.png" border="false"::: on the welcome screen.

If you’re using another Miracast-compatible device, look for "Miracast," "Screen sharing," or "Screen mirroring" in your settings to share your screen to the Surface Hub.

## Project using cables to Surface Hub 2S

To project your screen with cables, connect using the ports along the bottom edge of the compute cartridge. The compute cartridge has an HDMI port, a USB-C port, USB-A, as well as the ethernet port and DisplayPort.

You can project in with USB-C or HDMI—the DisplayPort is only for mirroring your Surface Hub’s screen on another screen.

## Control your laptop from the Surface Hub

Sometimes when you’re presenting or collaborating on Surface Hub, you’ll want to be able to leave your laptop at your seat and be able to fully pay attention to what's on the big screen.

When you've connected a device that has Windows 8 or later to Surface Hub, on that device, you’ll see a checkbox to **Allow mouse, keyboard, touch, and pen input**.

When this is checked, you’ll be able to use touch and inking on the Surface Hub to control and make changes on your own connected device. If you’re connecting via USB-C, you’ll be able to use the touch and inking to make changes on your device automatically. However, if you’re connecting with HDMI, you’ll need to connect a USB cable as well to use touch and pen input on your device.
