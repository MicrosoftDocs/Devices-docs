# Sign in to Surface Hub with Microsoft Authenticator

People in your organization can sign in to a Surface Hub  without a password using the Microsoft Authenticator app, available on Android and iOS.

## Organization prerequisites

To let people in your organization sign in to Surface Hub with their phones and other devices instead of a password, you’ll need to make sure that your organization meets these prerequisites: 

- Your organization must be a hybrid or cloud-only organization, backed by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). For more information, see [What is Azure Active Directory?](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis)

- Make sure you have at minimum an Office 365 E3 subscription. 

- [Configure Multi-Factor Authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings). Make sure **Notification through mobile app** is selected.
