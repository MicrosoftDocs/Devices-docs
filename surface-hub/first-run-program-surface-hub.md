# First time setup for Surface Hub

When you first start Surface Hub, the device automatically enters first time Setup mode to guide you through account configuration and related settings.

> [!TIP]
> As a companion to this article, we recommend using the [Surface Hub and Microsoft Teams Rooms automated setup guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2221605) when signed in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. This guide will customize your experience based on your environment. If you're hosted in Exchange Online and using Microsoft Teams, the guide will automatically create your device account with the correct settings. Or use it to validate existing resource accounts to help turn them into compatible Surface Hub device accounts. To review best practices without signing in and activating automated setup features, go to the [M365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222648). 

> [!NOTE]
> You can automate the entire setup process with a [Provisioning package](#use-provisioning-packages) to ensure a consistent experience across multiple Surface Hubs.

## Get started

1. By default, Cortana is enabled to guide you through the process. To turn off Cortana assistance, select the microphone icon.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-cortana.png" alt-text="Cortana is enabled to guide you through the process.":::

2. **Select your region.** Confirm the auto-detected region and select **Yes**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-region.png" alt-text="Select your region.":::

3. **Confirm keyboard layout.** Select **Yes**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-keyboard.png" alt-text="Confirm keyboard layout.":::

4. To add a second keyboard, select **Add layout**. Otherwise, select **Skip**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-2keyboard.png" alt-text="Add a second keyboard.":::

5. **Connect to a network.** If you have already attached an Ethernet cable, Surface Hub automatically connects to your network. Alternatively, you can connect to a wireless network. **Note:** You cannot connect to a wireless network in hotspots (captive portals) that redirect sign-in requests to a provider's website. Select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-network.png" alt-text="Connect to a network.":::

6. **Accept Windows 10 License Agreement.** Select **Accept**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-license.png" alt-text="Accept Windows 10 License Agreement.":::

7. **Enter Device account info** using either a UPN address (user@contoso.com) or a down-level domain address (CONTOSO\user). Use the format that matches your environment and enter the password.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-device-account.png" alt-text="Enter Device account info.":::

  | Environment                                              | Required format for device account |
  | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | Device account is hosted only online                     | username@contoso.com               |
  | Device account is hosted only on-premises                | CONTOSO\user                       |
  | Device account is hosted online and on-premises (hybrid) | CONTOSO\user                       |

  > [!NOTE]
  > Although you can skip setting up a device account, the device will not be fully integrated into your infrastructure. If you skip setting it up now, you can add a device account later by using the Settings app.

8. **Enter your password** and select **Next**.

9. Surface Hub automatically detects Exchange server and SIP address info from the domain entered in the previous step. Or if needed, provide your Exchange server address and select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-exchange.png" alt-text="Exchange server and SIP address.":::

10. **Name this device.** Enter a name for your device or use the suggested one. **Select Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-name.png" alt-text="Name this device.":::

   - The **Friendly name** is visible on the bottom left corner of Surface Hub 2S and is shown when projecting to the device.
   - The **Device name** identifies the device when affiliated with Active Directory or Azure Active Directory, and when enrolling the device with Intune.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you plan to affliate the Surface Hub with Active Directory, the device name must meet the [standard requirements for computer names in AD](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou#computer-names), otherwise setup will fail.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you want to enable [Miracast over Infrastructure](miracast-over-infrastructure.md), the device name needs to be discoverable via DNS. You can achieve this by either allowing your Surface Hub to register automatically via Dynamic DNS, or by manually creating an A or AAAA record for the Surface Hub's device name.

### Configure device admin accounts

You can only set up device admins during first time Setup. For more information, refer to:

- [Surface Hub 2S device affiliation](/surface-hub/prepare-your-environment-for-surface-hub#device-affiliation)
- [Admin Group Management](admin-group-management-for-surface-hub.md)

1. **Choose type of admin account.** Select one of the following options: Active Directory Domain Services, Azure Active Directory, or Local admin.

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-join.png" alt-text="Choose type of admin account.":::

### Active Directory Domain Services

1. If you intend to use Surface Hub in an on-premises environment, you can affiliate Hub with **Active Directory Domain Services**.  Enter the credentials of a user who has permissions to join the device to Active Directory.
2. Select the Active Directory Security Group containing members allowed to sign in to the Settings app on Surface Hub 2S.
3. Select **Finish**. The device will restart.

### Microsoft Azure Active Directory

1. If you intend to manage Surface Hub from the cloud using Microsoft Intune or an MDM provider, select **Microsoft Azure Active Directory**.
2. Select Next and sign in with a work or school account. If redirected, authenticate using your organizationâ€™s sign-in page and provide additional credentials if requested. Otherwise, enter your password and select **Next.**

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-signin.png" alt-text="The screenshot shows the dialog to sign in with a work or school account.":::

> [!TIP]
> To configure who can use the Settings app to manage Surface Hubs, ensure that automatic Intune enrollment is enabled in your tenant before joining the device to Azure AD. Intune policies can then be used to [configure non-Global admins](surface-hub-2s-nonglobal-admin.md) on Surface Hubs.

### Local Administrator account

- Enter a username and a memorable password for your local admin. (If you forget the local admin password you will need to [recover your device](surface-hub-2s-recover-reset.md) and repeat the setup process.)  

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-local-admin.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows the field to enter a memorable password for local admin account.":::

### Choose privacy settings for your device

- Select from the available privacy settings and select **Accept.**

    :::image type="content" source="images/hub-setup-privacy.png" alt-text="This screenshot shows the dialog to choose privacy settings.":::

### Use provisioning packages

You can customize first time setup options, allowing you to ensure a consistent experience across multiple Surface Hubs.

1. To begin, review the documentation in [Create provisioning packages](provisioning-packages-for-surface-hub.md) and save the provisioning package to a USB thumb drive.
2. Insert the USB thumb drive into one of the USB ports when you see the License Agreement page (step 6 in the ["Get started"](#get-started) steps above).
3. When prompted, choose the provisioning package you'd like to use.
4. If you created a multiple devices CSV file, you will be able to choose a device configuration.
6. Follow the rest of the steps, and remove the USB drive at the first reboot that occurs in the setup process.
