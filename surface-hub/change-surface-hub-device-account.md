# Change the Microsoft Surface Hub device account


You can change the device account in Settings to either add an account if one was not already provisioned, or to change any properties of an account that was already provisioned.

## What happens?


The UPN and password are used to validate the account in AD or Azure AD. If the validation fails, you may need to provide the domain and user name.

Using the credentials provided, we will try to discover the SIP address. If a SIP address can't be found, then Skype for Business will use the UPN as the SIP address. If this is not the SIP address for the account, you will need to provide the SIP address.

The Exchange server address will need to be provided if the device can't find a server associated with the login credentials. Microsoft Surface Hub will use the Exchange server to talk to ActiveSync, which enables several key features on the device.
