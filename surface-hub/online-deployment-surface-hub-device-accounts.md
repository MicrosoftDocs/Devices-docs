# Online deployment with Office 365 (Surface Hub)


This topic has instructions for adding a device account for your Microsoft Surface Hub when you have a pure, online deployment.

If you have a pure, online (O365) deployment, then you can [use the provided PowerShell scripts](appendix-a-powershell-scripts-for-surface-hub.md#create-os356-ps-scripts) to create device accounts. 

1. Start a remote PowerShell session on a PC and connect to Exchange.

   Be sure you have the right permissions set to run the associated cmdlets.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   $org='contoso.microsoft.com'
   $cred=Get-Credential admin@$org
   $sess= New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
   Import-PSSession $sess
   ```

2. After establishing a session, you’ll either create a new mailbox and enable it as a RoomMailboxAccount, or change the settings for an existing room mailbox. This will allow the account to authenticate into the Surface Hub.

   If you're changing an existing resource mailbox:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-Mailbox -Identity 'HUB01' -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String <password> -AsPlainText -Force)
   ```

   If you’re creating a new resource mailbox:

   ```PowerShell
   New-Mailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID HUB01@contoso.com -Alias HUB01 -Name "Hub-01" -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String <password> -AsPlainText -Force)
   ```

3. After setting up the mailbox, you will need to either create a new Exchange ActiveSync policy, or use a compatible existing policy.

   Surface Hubs are only compatible with device accounts that have an ActiveSync policy where the **PasswordEnabled** property is set to False. If this isn’t set properly, then Exchange services on the Surface Hub (mail, calendar, and joining meetings), will not be enabled.

   If you haven’t created a compatible policy yet, use the following cmdlet—this one creates a policy called "Surface Hubs". Once it’s created, you can apply the same policy to other device accounts.

   ```PowerShell
   $easPolicy = New-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Name "SurfaceHubs" -PasswordEnabled $false -AllowNonProvisionableDevices $True
   ```

   Once you have a compatible policy, then you will need to apply the policy to the device account.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-CASMailbox 'HUB01@contoso.com' -ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy $easPolicy.Id
   ```

4. Various Exchange properties must be set on the device account to improve the meeting experience. You can see which properties need to be set in the [Exchange properties](exchange-properties-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) section.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity 'HUB01@contoso.com' -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -AllowConflicts $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -RemovePrivateProperty $false
   Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity 'HUB01@contoso.com' -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Surface Hub room!"
   ```

5. Connect to Azure AD.
    
   You first need to install Azure AD module for PowerShell version 2. In an elevated powershell prompt run the following command :
    
   ```PowerShell
   Install-Module -Name AzureAD
   ```
   You need to connect to Azure AD to apply some account settings. You can run this cmdlet to connect.

   ```PowerShell
   Import-Module AzureAD
   Connect-AzureAD -Credential $cred
   ```

6. If you decide to have the password not expire, you can set that with PowerShell cmdlets too. See [Password management](password-management-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) for more information.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-AzureADUser -ObjectId "HUB01@contoso.com" -PasswordPolicies "DisablePasswordExpiration"
   ```

7. Surface Hub requires a license for Skype for Business functionality. In order to enable Skype for Business, your environment will need to meet the [prerequisites for Skype for Business online](hybrid-deployment-surface-hub-device-accounts.md#skype-for-business-online).
   
   Next, you can use `Get-AzureADSubscribedSku` to retrieve a list of available SKUs for your O365 tenant.

   Once you list out the SKUs, you'll need to assign the SkuId you want to the `$License.SkuId` variable.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-AzureADUser -ObjectId "HUB01@contoso.com" -UsageLocation "US"
	
   Get-AzureADSubscribedSku | Select Sku*,*Units
   $License = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicense
   $License.SkuId = SkuId You selected 
	
   $AssignedLicenses = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicenses
   $AssignedLicenses.AddLicenses = $License
   $AssignedLicenses.RemoveLicenses = @()
	
   Set-AzureADUserLicense -ObjectId "HUB01@contoso.com"  -AssignedLicenses $AssignedLicenses
   ```

8. Enable the device account with Skype for Business.
   If the Skype for Business PowerShell module is not installed, [download the Skype for Business Online Windows PowerShell Module](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39366). 

   - Start by creating a remote PowerShell session from a PC.

     ```PowerShell
     Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector  
     $cssess=New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $cred  
     Import-PSSession $cssess -AllowClobber
     ```

   - Next, if you aren't sure what value to use for the `RegistrarPool` parameter in your environment, you can get the value from an existing Skype for Business user using this cmdlet (for example, <em>alice@contoso.com</em>):

       ```PowerShell
       Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity 'alice@contoso.com' | fl registrarpool
       ```
       OR by setting a variable
        
       ```PowerShell
       $strRegistrarPool = Get-CsOnlineUser -Identity 'alice@contoso.com' | fl registrarpool | out-string
       $strRegistrarPool = $strRegistrarPool.Substring($strRegistrarPool.IndexOf(':') + 2)
       ```
        
   - Enable the Surface Hub account with the following cmdlet:
      
       ```PowerShell
       Enable-CsMeetingRoom -Identity 'HUB01@contoso.com' -RegistrarPool yourRegistrarPool -SipAddressType EmailAddress
       ```
        
       OR using the $strRegistarPool variable from above
        
       ```PowerShell
       Enable-CsMeetingRoom -Identity 'HUB01@contoso.com' -RegistrarPool $strRegistrarPool -SipAddressType EmailAddress
       ```

For validation, you should be able to use any Skype for Business client (PC, Android, etc) to sign in to this account.
