# Connect other devices and display with Surface Hub

You can connect other devices to your Surface Hub to display content. This article describes the Guest Mode, Replacement PC Mode, and Video Out functionality available through wired connections and lists accessories you can connect to Surface Hub using [Bluetooth](#bluetooth-accessories).

>[!TIP]
>Surface Hub will use the video input you select until a new connection is made, the existing connection is disrupted, or the Connect App is closed.

## Which method should I choose?

When connecting external devices and displays to a Surface Hub, there are several available options. The method you use depends on your scenario and needs.

| When you want to: | Use this method: |
| --- | --- |
| Mirror the Surface Hub's display on another device. | [Video Out](#video-out) |
| Present another device's display on the Surface Hub screen and interact with both the device's content and the built-in Surface Hub experience. | [Guest Mode](#guest-mode) |
| Power the Surface Hub from an external Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC, turning off the embedded computer of the Surface Hub. Cameras, microphones, speakers, and other peripherals, are sent to the external PC, in addition to pen and touch. | [Replacement PC Mode](#replacement-pc-mode) |

## Guest Mode

Guest Mode uses a wired connection, so that users can display content from their devices to the Surface Hub. If the source device is Windows-based, that device can also provide Touchback and Inkback. Surface Hub's internal PC takes video and audio from the connected device and presents them on the Surface Hub. If Surface Hub encounters a High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) signal, the source is displayed as a black image. To display your content without violating HDCP requirements, use the keypad on the right side of the Surface Hub to directly choose the external source.

>[!TIP]
>When an HDCP source is connected, use the side  keypad to change source inputs.

### Ports

Use these ports on the Surface Hub for Guest Mode.

### Port enumeration

When a Surface Hub is connected to a guest computer with the wired connect USB port, several USB devices are discovered and configured. These peripheral devices are created for Touchback and Inkback. The peripheral devices can be viewed in Device Manager. Device Manager shows duplicate names for some devices.

#### Human interface devices

- HID-compliant consumer control device
- HID-compliant pen
- HID-compliant pen (duplicate item)
- HID-compliant pen (duplicate item)
- HID-compliant touch screen
- USB Input Device
- USB Input Device (duplicate item)

#### Keyboards

- Standard PS/2 keyboard

#### Mice and other pointing devices

- HID-compliant mouse

#### Universal serial bus controllers

- Generic USB hub

- USB composite device

### Guest Mode connectivity

Your choice of video cable depends on what is available from your source input. Surface Hub (v1) has three options for video input: DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA. See the following chart for available resolutions.

| Signal Type | Resolution | Frame rate | HDMI - RGB | DisplayPort | VGA |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --- |
| PC          | 640 x 480  | 59.94/60   | X          | X           | X   |
| PC          | 720 x 480  | 59.94/60   | X          | X           |     |
| PC          | 1024 x 768 | 60         | X          | X           | X   |
| HDTV        | 720p       | 59.94/60   | X          | X           | X   |
| HDTV        | 1080p      | 59.94/60   | X          | X           | X   |

Source audio is provided by DisplayPort and HDMI cables. If you must use VGA, Surface Hub has an audio input port with a 3.5-mm plug. Surface Hub also uses a USB cable that provides Touchback and Inkback from the Surface Hub to compatible Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices. The USB cable can be used with any video input that is already connected to a cable.

Someone using Guest Mode to connect a PC would use one of these options:

- **DisplayPort:** DisplayPort cable and USB 2.0 cable
- **HDMI:** HDMI cable and USB 2.0 cable
- **VGA:** VGA cable, 3.5-mm audio cable, and USB 2.0 cable

If the computer you're using for Guest Mode isn't compatible with Touchback and Inkback, you don't need the USB cable.

## Replacement PC Mode

In Replacement PC Mode, the embedded computer of the Surface Hub is turned off and an external PC is connected to the Surface Hub. Connections to replacement PC ports give access to key peripherals on the Surface Hub, including the screen, pen, and touch features. This does mean that your Surface Hub won’t have the benefit of the Windows Team experience, but you'll have the flexibility offered by providing and managing your own Windows computer.

### Software requirements

You can run Surface Hub in Replacement PC Mode with 64-bit versions of Windows 10 or Windows 11 Home, Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro, and Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise. You can download the  [Surface Hub Replacement PC driver package](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52210) from the Microsoft Download Center. We recommend that you install these drivers on any computer you plan to use as a replacement PC.

### Hardware requirements

Surface Hub is compatible with a range of hardware. Choose the processor and memory confirmation for your replacement PC so that it supports the programs you're using. Your replacement PC hardware needs to support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 or Windows 11.

### Graphics adapter

In Replacement PC Mode, Surface Hub supports any graphics adapter that can produce a DisplayPort signal. You improve your experience with a graphics adapter that can match Surface Hub's resolution and refresh rate. For example, the best and recommended replacement PC experience on the Surface Hub is with a 120-Hz video signal.

- **55" Surface Hubs:** For best experience, use a graphics card capable of 1080p resolution at 120 Hz.
- **84" Surface Hubs:** For best experience, use a graphics card capable of outputting four DisplayPort 1.2 streams to produce 2160p at 120 Hz (3840 x 2160 at 120-Hz vertical refresh). Such graphics cards include: NVIDIA Quadro K2200, NVIDIA Quadro K4200, NVIDIA Quadro M6000, AMD FirePro W5100, AMD FirePro W7100, and AMD FirePro W9100. 

Check directly with graphics card vendors for the latest drivers.

## Cables

Both the 55” and 84” Surface Hub devices have been tested to work with Certified DisplayPort and HDMI cables.  While vendors do sell longer cables that may work with the Surface Hub, only those cables that have been certified by testing labs are certain to work with the Hub. For example, DisplayPort cables are certified only up to 3 meters, however many vendors sell cables that are three times that length. If a long cable is necessary, we strongly suggest using HDMI.  HDMI has many cost-effective solutions for long-haul cables, including the use of repeaters. Nearly every DisplayPort source automatically switches to HDMI signaling if an HDMI sink is detected.

## Bluetooth accessories

You can connect the following accessories to Surface Hub using Bluetooth:

- Mice
- Keyboards
- Headsets
- Speakers

>[!TIP]
>After you connect a Bluetooth headset or speaker, you might need to change the [default microphone and speaker settings](local-management-surface-hub-settings.md).
