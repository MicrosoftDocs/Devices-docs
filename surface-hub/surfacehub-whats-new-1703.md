## Provisioning wizard

An easy-to-use wizard helps you quickly create provisioning packages that you can apply to multiple Surface Hub devices, and includes bulk join to Azure Active Directory. [Learn how to create a provisioning package for Surface Hub.](provisioning-packages-for-certificates-surface-hub.md)
