# Troubleshoot Teams sign-in issues on Surface Hub

If you can't sign in to Microsoft Teams on Surface Hub, several recommended troubleshooting steps are described on this page.
 
- First, make sure your Surface Hub is running the latest updates. `To learn more, see the following video: [How to verify a Surface Hub is fully updated](https://youtu.be/rxL5cUS_3TA).
- Check Microsoft Teams is updated to the latest version. On Surface Hub, open **Microsoft** **Teams**, select **â€¦** > **Settings** > **Check for updates**.

- Use the [Azure sign-in logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-troubleshoot-sign-in-errors#troubleshoot-sign-in-errors-using-the-sign-ins-report) for insights into sign-in errors. You can filter by the Surface Hub device account and look for any failures.
- If you still can't sign in, look for the error code displayed on the Teams sign-in screen and review the following table for troubleshooting steps and links to relevant documentation.

## Support requests

If you still can't successfully sign in to Teams, you can [create a support request](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding?). Include the following items: 

- Any error codes displayed when you attempt to sign in to Teams.
- Log files, as noted below. 
 

### Diagnostic Teams log files

When creating a support request with Microsoft Support, the support engineer will require diagnostic log files. Having the logs before creating the support request will allow Microsoft to quickly start troubleshooting the problem.

**To collect Teams log files:** 

1. Connect an external keyboard to Surface Hub. 
2. Open the Teams app and reproduce the issue by attempting to sign in.  
3. Select the Teams app and ensure the focus is on Teams as the active app on the Hub display. 
4. On your keyboard, press **Tab** three times to highlight the UI element for settings, represented by three dots (**...**). 
5. Press **CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + 1** to download the Teams log files.
6. Open **File Explorer**, go to **Downloads**, and look for the folder containing the Teams log files. 
7. Copy the folder to a USB drive. 

To learn more, see [Configure log files for monitoring and troubleshooting in Teams](/microsoftteams/log-files)
 
### Surface Hub & Azure log files

- [Surface Hub log files](/surface-hub/collect-surface-hub-log-files)
- Any applicable [Azure sign-in logs](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-troubleshoot-sign-in-errors#troubleshoot-sign-in-errors-using-the-sign-ins-report) that indicate sign-in failure.
