# Surface Hub v1 Site Readiness Guide

Use this Site Readiness Guide to help plan your Surface Hub installation.

## Site readiness planning

The room needs to be large enough to provide good viewing angles, but small enough for the microphones to pick up clear signals from the people in the room. Most rooms that are about 22 feet (seven meters) long will provide a good meeting experience. In the conference area, mount Surface Hub where:

- Everyone in the room can see it.
- People can reach all four edges of the touchscreen.
- The screen isn't in direct sunlight, which could affect viewing or damage the screen.
- Ventilation openings aren't blocked.
- Microphones aren't affected by noise sources, such as fans or vents.
You can find more details in the [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md) sections.

### Hardware considerations

Surface Hub arrives with:

- Two Microsoft Surface Hub pens
- A Microsoft wireless keyboard, customized for Surface Hub
- A 9-foot NEMA 5-15P (US Standard) to C13 power cable

You’ll need to provide:

- Cat-5e or Cat-6 network cables
- Display cables (optional)
- Audio cable (optional)
- Type A to B USB cable (optional)

For details about cable ports, see the [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md) sections. For details about cables, see [Wired Connect](#wired).

Microsoft Surface Hub has an internal PC and doesn't require an external computer system.

For power recommendations, see [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md).

### Data and other connections

To use Surface Hub, you need an active Ethernet port and a standard power outlet. In addition, you may want to:

- Equip the conference table for Wired Connect.
- Expand the wall outlet configuration to include:
  - Additional AC outlets
  - Ethernet ports
  - Audio ports
  - Video ports (DisplayPort, HDMI, VGA, etc.)

## When Surface Hub arrives

Surface Hub is large and heavy, so let Receiving know when it will arrive and what they should do to handle it safely. For details on the packing weights and other specifications, see [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md).

Consider the following:

- Wait to unpack Surface Hub from the shipping container until you’ve moved it to the conference area where you plan to install it.
- Make sure your loading dock can accept a shipment on a pallet and hold it securely until it can be installed.
- Check for local labor union rules that would require you to use union labor to unload or move Surface Hub.
- Don't leave Surface Hub in a hot or humid environment. As with any computer-based or display equipment, heat and humidity can damage Surface Hub. The recommended storage temperatures are 32°F to 95°F with a relative humidity of less than 70 percent.

### Moving Surface Hub

Before you move Surface Hub, make sure that all the doorways, thresholds, hallways, and elevators are large enough to accommodate it. For information on the dimensions and weight of your Surface Hub in its shipping container, see [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md).

### Unpacking Surface Hub

For unpacking information, refer to the unpacking guide included in the shipping container. You can open the unpacking instructions before you open the shipping container.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Retain and store all Surface Hub shipping materials—including the pallet, container, and screws—in case you need to ship Surface Hub to a new location or send it
for repairs. For the 84” Surface Hub, retain the lifting handles.

### Lifting Surface Hub

The 55” Surface Hub requires two people to safely lift and mount. The 84” Surface Hub requires four people to safely lift and mount. Those assisting must be able to lift 70 pounds to waist height. Review the unpacking and mounting guide for details on lifting Surface Hub.

## Mounting and setup

There are three ways to mount your Surface Hub:

- **Wall mount**: Lets you permanently hang Surface Hub on a conference space wall.
- **Floor support mount**: Supports Surface Hub on the floor while it's permanently anchored to a conference space wall.
- **Rolling stand**: Supports Surface Hub and lets you move it to other conference locations.

For specifications on available mounts for the original Surface Hub, see the following:

## The Connect experience

Connect lets people project their laptop, tablet, or phone to the Surface Hub screen. Connect allows wireless or wired connection types.

### Wireless connect

Since wireless connect is based on Miracast, you don’t need cables or additional setup planning to use it. Your users can load Miracast on most Miracast-enabled Windows devices. Then they can project their display from their computer or phone to the Surface Hub screen.

#### Wired connect

With wired connect, a cable transmits information from computers, tablets, or phones to Surface Hub. There are three video cable options, and they all use the same USB 2.0 cable. The cable bundle can include one or all of these connection options.

- DisplayPort (DisplayPort cable + USB 2.0 cable)
- HDMI (HDMI cable + USB 2.0 cable)
- VGA (VGA cable + 3.5 mm audio cable + USB 2.0 cable)

For example, to provide audio, video, and touchback capability to all three video options, your Wired Connect cable bundle must include:

- A DisplayPort cable
- An HDMI cable
- A VGA cable
- A USB 2.0 cable
- A 3.5-mm cable

When you create your wired connect cable bundles, check the [Surface Hub (v1) 55" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-55.md) or [Surface Hub (v1) 84" tech specs](surface-hub-technical-84.md) sections for specific technical and physical details and port locations for each type of Surface Hub. Make the cables long enough to reach from Surface Hub to where the presenter will sit or stand.
