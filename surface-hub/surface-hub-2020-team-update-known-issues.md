| Optional non-security updates (also referred to as "C" and "D" releases) are not being installed on certain Hub devices.            | Surface Hub improvements are generally delivered through non-security updates on the 3rd Tuesday of each month ("C" release). This issue results in having to wait until the next month's 2nd Tuesday ("B" release security updates) to receive Hub-specific cumulative updates. | No remedy at this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Calendar sync fails when device account UPN and SMTP address do not match.                                                                        | Hubs are trying to use SMTP address to authenticate instead of UPN. In this scenario, Exchange stops syncing meetings to the device. As a result, the device does not receive new meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | After [KB4598291](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4598291) (or a subsequent Windows CU) is installed, calendar sync will work again for these types of accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Calendar sync with on-premises mailboxes fails if customer environment does not support Hybrid Modern Authentication.   | Surface Hub devices try to force Hybrid Modern Authentication for on-premises mailboxes when customers have not enabled this in their environment. In this scenario, Exchange stops syncing meetings to the device. As a result, the device does not receive or display new meetings.                                                                                                                                        | After [KB4598291](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4598291) (or a subsequent Windows CU) is installed, the [SurfaceHub CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/surfacehub-csp) has a new ExchangeModernAuthEnabled parameter available to toggle Hybrid Modern Authentication (HMA). This can be set to false via MDM policy or [provisioning package](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/F/83FD5089-D14E-42E3-AF7C-6FC36F80D347/ExchangeModernAuthDisabled.ppkg) to prevent the Hub from using HMA. Alternatively, customers can enable HMA in their on-premises Exchange environment -- but only if their topology allows it. <br> <br>**Learn more:** [How to configure Exchange Server on-premises to use Hybrid Modern Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/configure-exchange-server-for-hybrid-modern-authentication).                                                                                                |
| Sign in is impacted when Conditional Access policy settings are applied.                                    | When a device is configured using a Compliance policy setting that requires device-level information (for example, “Require Firewall”), a Conditional Access Error 53000 is triggered. When this occurs users cannot sign in to the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Customers can exclude Compliance policy settings that require device-level information from executing on Surface Hub devices. If this is not possible due to compliance or security restrictions, Hub devices should not install the 2020 update.<br> <br>**Learn more**: [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](https:/docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started). |

| Single sign-on fails for Azure Active Directory joined devices when using a phone to sign in to Surface Hub | If an IT Admin has configured the tenant to use [passwordless authentication](surface-hub-2s-phone-authenticate.md) to sign in to Surface Hub and the device is AAD-joined, users cannot sign in using a mobile device such as a phone.                                                                                                       | Manually sign in to Surface Hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Action Center has an unclickable Settings link. | This link should not appear in Windows 10 Team and may cause confusion.   | The functionality is the same as before the 2020 update; the  Apps section of the Start menu should be used to launch the Settings app.    |
| Hub 2S Devices reporting all 0s for Serial Number after updating to November 24, 2020 update for Windows 10 Team 2020 for 2S. | After installing the Surface Hub 2S November 24 update for Windows 10 Team 2020 or installing the Windows 10 Team 2020 recovery image (BMR), some devices are reporting all zeros for the Serial Number. This prevents devices from enrolling into MDM providers.  | This issue occurred when a device did not have **Surface SMC Firmware update 1.177.139.0** (part of the September 1, 2020 update for Windows 10 Team Creators Update) before moving to **SMC Firmware update 3.91.139.0** (included in the original Windows 10 Team 2020 BMR, or part of the November 24, 2020 update for Windows 10 Team 2020). As **Surface SMC Firmware update 3.93.139.0** is now included in the current Windows 10 Team 2020 BMR and offered to Surface Hub 2S devices via Windows Update, it is no longer possible to run into this issue. Devices already impacted will have a new serial number generated once the firmware update is installed. Please note that the device will need to be rebooted twice after the update is installed to complete the installation. **Learn more**: [Surface Hub update history](surface-hub-update-history.md). |
