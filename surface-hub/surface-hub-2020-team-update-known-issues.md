# Known issues: Surface Hub

This article lists known issues for Surface Hubs running the current operating system, Windows 10 Team 2020 Update.

To ensure Surface Hub receives the latest updates, sign in with an Admin account and select **All apps** > **Settings** > **Update and Security** > **Windows Update**, and then install all updates.

| Issue               | Description           | Remedy                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| When using the Whiteboard Application on Surface Hub devices, the contents cannot be shared via email. | The "Easy Share" feature has been removed from the new version of the Whiteboard app. | The recommended way to save Whiteboard contents is to sign-in to the app. If sign-in is not possible, an image file can be saved to local storage and then shared through a user-preferred service via the Edge browser. The "Easy Share" feature will return in a future version of the Whiteboard. [Learn more about Whiteboard sharing scenarios.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-microsoft-whiteboard-for-your-organization-1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24) |
| Some Surface Hubs are restarting when a user selects 'End Session'.  | When Surface Hub device users select the 'End Session' functionality to clear user data, the Surface Hub device may erroneously detect a cleanup failure, forcing a restart of Windows to ensure clean up occurs successfully.  | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.  Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible.|
| A small subset of Surface Hub 2S devices has encountered unexpected shutdowns with the thermometer icon displayed. | During regular use, some Hub 2S devices may detect an emergency thermal situation and trigger a shutdown. | A firmware update to change the thermal triggers and improve logging relating to emergency shutdowns has been released as "System Hardware Update - 5/19/2022".<br> <br>**Learn more**: [Surface Hub Update History](surface-hub-update-history.md) |
| Use of the [Surface Hub password rotation feature](password-management-for-surface-hub-device-accounts.md) may not work as expected in some scenarios. | Surface Hubs may fail to rotate passwords for Azure AD-based device accounts. If the device account password expires, the Surface Hub would not be able to sync its calendar or join Teams meetings. | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue. Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible.<br> <br>As a workaround, password expiry for impacted accounts could be disabled or extended. |
| Quality of Service (QoS) settings do not work as expected. | After configuring QoS settings via MDM policy or provisioning package, DSCP markings are not being applied to Teams or Skype for Business (SfB) media traffic. | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.  Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible. |
| Authentication of hybrid device accounts with on-premises mailboxes fails. | Surface Hub devices default to using Modern Authentication for accounts that exist in Azure AD, even if they have mailboxes in on-premises Exchange environments that don't have [Hybrid Modern Authentication](/microsoft-365/enterprise/configure-exchange-server-for-hybrid-modern-authentication) enabled. In this scenario, the account authentication fails. As a result, it may not be possible to add a new device account or sync an existing one. | After [KB4598291](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4598291) (or a subsequent Windows CU) is installed, the [SurfaceHub CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/surfacehub-csp) has a new ExchangeModernAuthEnabled parameter available to toggle the use of Modern Authentication. This can be set to false via MDM policy or [provisioning package](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/F/83FD5089-D14E-42E3-AF7C-6FC36F80D347/ExchangeModernAuthDisabled.ppkg) to prevent the Hub from using Modern Authentication. |
| A small subset of v1 Surface Hub devices is not able to automatically upgrade to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update. | This small subset of v1 Surface Hub devices is in a state that is preventing compatibility with direct upgrade via Windows Update. | Manually reimage the device to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update [using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool](surface-hub-recovery-tool.md). |
| Surface Hub displays "No bootable device" message after attempting to install the Windows 10 Team 2020 update. | During the Windows Update process for Windows 10 Team 2020, some Hub v1 devices will go into an unbootable state. | Manually reimage the device to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update [using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool](surface-hub-recovery-tool.md). |
| Hub 2S devices are unable to receive driver updates using WSUS. | Surface Hub 2S supports Windows Update and Windows Update for Business to distribute drivers; distribution via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is not supported. | If using WSUS, migrate to Windows Update for Business.<br> <br>**Learn more**: [What is Windows update for business?](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) |
| Action Center has an unclickable Settings link. | This link should not appear in Windows 10 Team and may cause confusion. | The functionality is the same as before the 2020 update; the  Apps section of the Start menu should be used to launch the Settings app.  |
| Some ease-of-access settings persist after a session ends| When users turn on the High contrast toggle either from the Quick actions menu or from the Settings app, this toggle persists after the user session ends. Similarly, if users change the notifications display to indicate 7 seconds versus the admin-defined 5 seconds, it remains 7 seconds, even though other settings are reset to the admin-defined values. | Users can turn off the High Contrast toggle from the quick actions(caret) menu accessible on the Taskbar soon after launching a session on the Hub. Display duration of notifications can be set to a different value via the Settings app by the next user - this setting is accessible to all users. Microsoft is actively looking to find a resolution to this issue.|
