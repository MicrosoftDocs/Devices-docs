# Secure and manage Surface Hub 2S with SEMM and UEFI

New in Surface Hub 2S, you can use SEMM to manage the UEFI setting of the device.
Use the Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator to control the following components:

- Wired LAN
- Cameras
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi
- Occupancy sensor

Use the Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator to turn on or off the following UEFI settings:

- Boot

  - IPv6 for PXE Boot
  - Alternate Boot
  - Boot Order Lock
  - USB Boot
- UEFI Front Page

  - Devices
  - Boot
  - Date/Time

## Create UEFI configuration image

Unlike other Surface devices, you cannot use an MSI file or a Win PE image to apply these settings on Surface Hub 2S. Instead, you need to create a USB image to load into the device. To create a Surface Hub 2S UEFI configuration image, download and install the latest version of the Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator from the [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) page in the Microsoft Download Center. For more information about using UEFI and SEMM, see [Microsoft Surface Enterprise Management Mode](/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode).
