# Driver and firmware lifecycle for Surface Hub devices and accessories

In response to requests from customers for more detailed lifecycle information to help plan and manage hardware and software deployments, Surface is offering additional guidance on our driver and firmware updates.
 
This lifecycle policy covers driver and firmware releases for Windows-based Surface Hub devices and accessories. The lifecycle begins when a device is first released and concludes when Surface ceases publication of driver and firmware updates on the End of Servicing date. The following sections define the lifecycle policy and End of Servicing dates.

## Surface Hub Devices and Accessories Driver and Firmware Lifecycle policy

The Surface Hub Devices and Accessories Driver and Firmware Lifecycle is composed of two parts: (1) the driver and firmware support period for a device/accessory and (2) the support provided for OS versions during that period.
 
### Hub device/accessory support period

The device support period defines the period during which Surface will support driver and firmware updates for a Surface Hub device and accessories. The Device/Accessory Support Period starts when a device/accessory is released.

- **For Hub devices/accessories released before January 1, 2021:** Surface Hub devices and accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least four years from when the device/accessory was first released. In cases where the support duration is longer than four years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.
- **For Hub devices/accessories released on and after January 1, 2021:** Surface Hub devices and accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least six years from when the device/accessory was first released. In cases where the support duration is longer than six years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.

### OS version support

OS version support defines the operating system versions Surface supports during the Device Support Period. To see your Surface Hub device's minimum supported OS version, visit the [Surface supported operating systems support page](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2858199/surface-supported-operating-systems). Surface Hub devices will receive driver and firmware updates for the most recent release of Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 Team (Surface Hub).
 
Once the Surface Hub device support period is concluded at the End of the Driver and Firmware Servicing Date, Hub devices will continue to receive Windows OS feature and security updates per the Windows Lifecycle Policy as described on the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy support page](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338/microsoft-lifecycle-policy).
