# Surface Hub and accessories driver and firmware lifecycle

This page provides essential information on the driver and firmware lifecycle for Surface Hub devices and accessories, designed to assist IT admins in effectively planning and managing their hardware and software deployment strategies.

The lifecycle policy covers driver and firmware releases for Surface Hub devices and accessories. The lifecycle begins when a device is first released and concludes when Surface ceases publication of driver and firmware updates on the epnd-of-servicing date. The following sections define the lifecycle policy and end-of-servicing dates.

This policy outlines the lifecycle of driver and firmware updates for Surface Hub devices and accessories. It begins on the initial release of a device and extends until the designated end-of-servicing date when Surface ceases to publish updates. The following sections detail the policy and specify end-of-servicing dates.

## Overview

The Surface Hub devices and accessories driver and firmware lifecycle consists of two parts: 

- The [driver and firmware servicing period](#hub-deviceaccessory-servicing-period) for a device/accessory.
- The [support provided for OS versions](#os-version-support) during that period.

### Hub device/accessory servicing period

The device/accessory servicing period defines the period that updates are available for Surface Hub and accessories. The device/accessory servicing period starts when a device/accessory is released.

- **For Hub devices/accessories released before January 1, 2021:** Surface Hub devices and accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least four years from when the device/accessory was first released. In cases where the servicing duration is longer than four years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.

- **For Hub devices/accessories released on and after January 1, 2021:** Surface Hub devices and accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least six years from when the device/accessory was first released. In cases where the servicing duration is longer than six years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.

### OS version support

OS version support defines the operating system versions Surface supports during the device/accessory servicing period. To see your Surface Hub device's minimum supported OS version, visit the [Surface supported operating systems support page](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2858199/surface-supported-operating-systems). Depending on the model, Surface Hub devices will receive driver and firmware updates for the most recent release of Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise or Windows 10 Team edition (Surface Hub).

When the Surface Hub device support period concludes at the end-of-servicing date for drivers and firmware, Hub devices will continue to receive Windows OS feature and security updates per the Windows Lifecycle Policy, as described on the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy support page](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338/microsoft-lifecycle-policy).
