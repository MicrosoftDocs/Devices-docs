# Essential add-ons for Windows Pro and Enterprise on Surface Hub

If you have migrated to Windows Pro or Enterprise, you can choose from a wide variety of accessories that connect via USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, or Bluetooth. 

## Surface Hub Fingerprint Reader

If youâ€™re running Windows Pro or Enterprise on Surface Hub, you can sign in using the optional Surface Hub Fingerprint Reader, a biometric authentication option that uses [Windows Hello](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello).
