# Troubleshoot Surface Hub 2 pen

If you encounter issues with your Surface Hub 2 pen, follow the troubleshooting steps on this page.

1. First, make sure your pen has a working battery. If the indicator light on the pen shows **solid white**, the pen is ready for use. If the indicator light shows **solid red** or no light, replace the battery on the pen. The Surface Hub 2S pen requires a single **AAA battery.**

2. If the pen isn't functioning as expected, pair it to Surface Hub 2S via Bluetooth to ensure itâ€™s running the latest firmware. Press and hold the Eraser and top button until the indicator light starts blinking. This enables the pen to be discoverable via Bluetooth.

> [!TIP]
> If the indicator light does not start blinking (even with new a new battery), try reseating the eraser cap.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **sign in as an administrator** and select **Devices (Bluetooth, printers, mouse).**
2. Ensure Bluetooth is turned **On.**
3. If the pen is already connected to the Surface Hub, you should see **Surface Hub 2 Pen** listed under **Mouse, keyboard, & pen.**
4. If you don't see the pen listed here, select the **+** button to **Add Bluetooth or other device.**
5. Once you see the **Surface Hub 2 Pen** listed in the results, you can add the pen from here.
