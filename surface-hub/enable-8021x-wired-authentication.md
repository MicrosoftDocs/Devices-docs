# Enable 802.1x wired authentication

The [November 14, 2017 update to Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4048954/windows-10-update-kb4048954) (build 15063.726) enabled 802.1x wired authentication policy configuration on Surface Hub devices. The feature allows organizations to enforce standardized wired network authentication using the [IEEE 802.1x authentication protocol](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1x-2010.html). This was already available for wireless authentication using [WLAN profiles](/mem/intune/configuration/wi-fi-settings-import-windows-8-1) via MDM or provisioning package. This topic explains how to configure a Surface Hub for use with wired authentication. 

Enforcement and enablement of 802.1x wired authentication on Surface Hub can be done through MDM [OMA-URI profiles](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-settings-windows-10) or provisioning package. 

The primary configuration to set is the **LanProfile** policy. Depending on the authentication method selected, other policies may be required, either the **EapUserData** policy or through MDM policies for adding user or machine certificates (such as [ClientCertificateInstall](/windows/client-management/mdm/clientcertificateinstall-csp) for user/device certificates or [RootCATrustedCertificates](/windows/client-management/mdm/rootcacertificates-csp) for device certificates). 

## LanProfile policy element

To configure Surface Hub to use one of the supported 802.1x authentication methods, utilize the following OMA-URI. 

```
./Vendor/MSFT/SurfaceHub/Dot3/LanProfile
```

This OMA-URI node takes a text string of XML as a parameter. The XML provided as a parameter should conform to the [Wired LAN Profile Schema](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpwl/c88a926a-087b-405f-9a76-effaf7277bf3) including elements from the [802.1X schema](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpwl/71f2eda6-d018-4ba3-ad37-32c98b926ebb). 

In most instances, an administrator or user can export the LanProfile XML from an existing PC that is already configured on the network for 802.1X using this following NETSH command. 

```
netsh lan export profile folder=.
```

Running this command will give the following output and place a file titled **Ethernet.xml** in the current directory. 

```
Interface: Ethernet
Profile File Name: .\Ethernet.xml
1 profile(s) were exported successfully.
```

To disable 802.1x completely on the Surface Hub, a [provisioning package](provisioning-packages-for-surface-hub.md#use-advanced-provisioning) can be used to set the SurfaceHub\Dot3\LanProfile node to the following xml:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<LANProfile xmlns="https://www.microsoft.com/networking/LAN/profile/v1">
   <MSM>
       <security>
           <OneXEnforced>false</OneXEnforced>
           <OneXEnabled>false</OneXEnabled>
       </security>
  </MSM>
</LANProfile>
```

## EapUserData policy element

If your selected authentication method requires a username and password as opposed to a certificate, you can use the **EapUserData** element to specify credentials for the device to use to authenticate to the network. 

```
./Vendor/MSFT/SurfaceHub/Dot3/EapUserData 
```

This OMA-URI node takes a text string of XML as a parameter. The XML provided as a parameter should conform to the [PEAP MS-CHAPv2 User Properties example](/windows/win32/eaphost/peap-ms-chapv2-user-properties). In the example, you will need to replace all instances of *test* and *ias-domain* with your information.



## Adding certificates

If your selected authentication method is certificate-based, you will need to [create a provisioning package](provisioning-packages-for-surface-hub.md), [utilize MDM](/windows/client-management/mdm/clientcertificateinstall-csp), or import a certificate from settings (**Settings** > **Update and Security** > **Certificates**) to deploy those certificates to your Surface Hub device in the appropriate Certificate Store. When adding certificates, each PFX must contain only one certificate (a PFX cannot have multiple certificates).
