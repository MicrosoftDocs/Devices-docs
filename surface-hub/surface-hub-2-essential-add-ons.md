# Essential add-ons for Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise on Surface Hub 2

If you have migrated from Windows 10 Team to Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise on Surface Hub 2, you can choose from a wide variety of accessories that connect via USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, or Bluetooth. 

## Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader

If you’re running Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise on Surface Hub 2, you can sign in using the optional Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader, a biometric authentication option that uses [Windows Hello](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello).

### Ordering

Commercial customers can place orders through their Surface Authorized Device Resellers.

**To use Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader:**

1. Insert the fingerprint reader into any of the USB C bezel ports, located on each side of the device.
2. **Go to Start** > **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Sign-in options** > **Windows Hello Fingerprint** to enroll your fingerprint.
