# Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Pack

The Surface Hub 3 Pack is a hardware upgrade that transforms your Surface Hub 2S device into a Surface Hub 3. To place an order, contact your [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS). 

## Remove old cartridge from Surface Hub 2S

1. Shut down Surface Hub 2S, unplug all cables and slide the cover sideways. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the retaining screw to detach the cartridge from Surface Hub 2S.

2. Slide the compute cartridge out. You can use the return label included in the packaging for the Surface Hub 3 Pack to send your old cartridge to Microsoft for recycling, if desired.
