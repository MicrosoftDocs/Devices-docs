# Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Pack

The Surface Hub 3 Pack is a hardware upgrade that transforms your Surface Hub 2S device into a Surface Hub 3. To place an order, contact your [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS).

## Install Surface Hub 3 Pack

### Prerequisites

- A Surface Hub 2S, fully updated with the latest Windows Updates. By default, updates are installed automatically during nightly maintenance. To verify, go to **All apps** > **Settings** > **Update and Security** > **Windows Update**, and install all updates.

> [!TIP]
> You may need to restart the device and continue to check for available updates. Ensure Surface Hub 2S has received one of the following updates: **Microsoft Corporation - System Hardware Update - 5/24/2023** or **Microsoft Corporation - System Hardware Update - 8/18/2023**.

- An account with admin privileges. You'll need to reset the device if you don't know your username or admin password. For more information, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-recover-reset).
- A resource account with a [supported Microsoft Teams Rooms license](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-licensing).

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Hub 3 Pack runs Windows 11 IoT Enterprise and does not support downgrading to Windows 10 Team or Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise. (If needed, you can reinstall the old cartridge to resume using Surface Hub 2S).

## Recycle Surface Hub 2S cartridge

You can now recycle your Surface Hub 2S cartridge if it no longer has use as a backup device for your IT department, or if you have upgraded to the Surface Hub 3 Pack. Youâ€™ll need to remove the hard drive from the cartridge to protect your sensitive data and meet global data retention requirements.

### Required removal of hard drive & corporate data

Before recycling your Surface Hub 2S cartridge, first remove the hard drive and delete any corporate data.

1. You'll need the compute cartridge and a screwdriver.

> [!TIP]
> Since both cartridges appear almost identical, we added two bumps to the edge of the Surface Hub 3 Pack cartridge. These bumps are located on the opposite side of the power socket, helping you differentiate between the two models.
