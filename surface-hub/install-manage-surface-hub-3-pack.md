# Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Pack

The Surface Hub 3 Pack is a hardware upgrade that transforms your Surface Hub 2S device into a Surface Hub 3. To place an order, contact your [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS).

## Prerequisites

- A Surface Hub 2S, fully updated with the latest Windows Updates. By default, updates are installed automatically during nightly maintenance. To verify, go to **All apps** > **Settings** > **Update and Security** > **Windows Update**, and install all updates.
- An account with admin privileges. If you don't know your user name or admin password, you'll need to reset the device. For more information, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-recover-reset).
- A resource account with a [supported Microsoft Teams Rooms license](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-licensing).

## Remove old cartridge from Surface Hub 2S

1. Shut down Surface Hub 2S, unplug all cables and slide the cover sideways.
