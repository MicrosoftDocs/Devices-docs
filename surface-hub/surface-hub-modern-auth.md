# Modern authentication on Surface Hub

The Windows 10 Team 2020 Update adds support for modern authentication of the Hub device account in some scenarios. Once you install the 2020 update, you can migrate from legacy basic authentication to make use of the latest security improvements if the device account authenticates via Microsoft Entra ID and the account's mailbox is hosted in Exchange Online. With the 2020 Update, Surface Hub supports Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocols and OAuth-based authentication when syncing the device account with Exchange Online.

For new cloud-based accounts, the Surface Hub automatically uses Modern Authentication to connect to Exchange Online without requiring additional configuration beyond simply adding the device account to the Surface Hub using the format [alias@contoso.com](mailto:alias@contoso.com). Do not use the legacy format â€“ Contoso\alias, which is not supported for modern authentication. For more information, see [create and test a device account](create-and-test-a-device-account-surface-hub.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Modern authentication is not supported for on-premises Surface Hub accounts. For full modern auth functionality, the accounts must use [cloud authentication in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn#cloud-authentication). If [federated authentication](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn#federated-authentication) is used, the account authentication with the federated identity provider will still use legacy protocols.
