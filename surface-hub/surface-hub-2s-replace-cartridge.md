| **1.** | Unplug all cables, slide the cover sideways, and unscrew the locking screw of the compute cartridge.                                            | ![Image that shows how to unplug all cables, slide the cover sideways, and unscrew the locking screw of the compute cartridge.](images/surface-hub-2s-replace-cartridge-2.png) |
| **2.**  | Slide the compute cartridge out of the unit.                                                                                                    | ![Image that shows how to slide the compute cartridge out of the unit.](images/surface-hub-2s-replace-cartridge-3.png) |
| **3.**  | You'll need the compute cartridge and a screwdriver.                                                                                          | ![Image that shows you will need the compute cartridge and a screwdriver.](images/surface-hub-2s-replace-cartridge-4.png) |
| **4.**  | Remove the cover screw and the cover from the compute cartridge, and then remove the solid state drive (SSD). When finished, replace the cover. | ![Image that shows how to remove the cover screw and the cover from the compute cartridge, and then remove the solid state drive (SSD).

| **5.**| You'll need the original packaging for your  replacement compute cartridge.                                              | ![Image that shows original packaging for your replacement compute cartridge.](images/surface-hub-2s-replace-cartridge-6.png) |
| **6.**| Place the old compute cartridge in the packaging.                                                                                      | ![Image that shows placement of the old compute cartridge in the packaging.](images/surface-hub-2s-replace-cartridge-7.png) |
| **7.** | Place the old compute cartridge and its packaging into the box that was used for the replacement compute cartridge. Reseal the box.             | ![Image that shows how to place the old compute cartridge and its packaging into the box that was used for the replacement compute cartridge.
