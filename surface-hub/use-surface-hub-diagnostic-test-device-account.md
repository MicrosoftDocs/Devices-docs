# Using the Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic Tool to test a device account

## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> The "Account Settings" section of the Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic tool doesn’t collect any information. The email and password that are entered as input are used only directly on your environment and not collected or transferred to anyone. The login information persists only until the application is closed or you end the current session on the Surface Hub.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Administrator privileges are not required to run this application.
> * The results of the diagnostic should be discussed with your local administrator before you open a service call with Microsoft.

### Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic

By default, the [Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh51f2g) application isn’t installed in earlier versions of the Surface Hub system. The application is available for free from the Microsoft Store. Administrator privileges are required to install the application.

## About the Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic Tool

The Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic tool is an easy-to-navigate tool that lets the user test many of the hardware components within the Surface Hub device. This tool can also test and verify a Surface Hub device account. This article describes how to use the Account Settings test within the Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The device account for the Surface Hub should be created before any testing is done. The Surface Hub Administrator Guide provides instructions and PowerShell scripts to help you create on-premises, online (Office365), or hybrid device accounts. For more information, go to the [Create and test a device account (Surface Hub)](https://learn.microsoft.com/surface-hub/create-and-test-a-device-account-surface-hub) topic in the guide.

### Device account testing process

1. Navigate to **All Apps**, and then locate the Surface Hub Hardware Diagnostic application.

1. When the application starts, the **Welcome** page provides a text window to document the reason why you are testing the Hub. This note can be saved to USB together with the diagnostic results at the conclusion of testing. After you finish entering a note, select the **Continue** button.

    >[!NOTE]
    >When saving diagnostic results, do not change the default path or select a subdirectory. The files can be copied later via the File Explorer app.
