## Device affiliation

Use Device affiliation to manage user access to the Settings app on Surface Hub. With the Windows 10 Team operating system (that runs on Surface Hub), only authorized users can adjust settings using the Settings app. Since choosing the affiliation can impact feature availability, plan appropriately to ensure that users can access features as intended.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set Device affiliation during the initial out-of-box experience (OOBE) setup. If you need to reset Device affiliation, you’ll have to repeat OOBE setup.

### No affiliation

No affiliation is like having Surface Hub in a workgroup with a different local Administrator account on each Surface Hub. If you choose No affiliation, you must locally save the [BitLocker Key to a USB thumb drive](/surface-hub/save-bitlocker-key-surface-hub). You can still enroll the device with Intune; however, only the local admin can access the Settings app using the account credentials configured during OOBE. You can change the Administrator account password from the Settings app.

### Active Directory Domain Services

If you affiliate Surface Hub with on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, you need to manage access to the Settings app using a security group on your domain. This helps ensure that all security group members have permissions to change settings on Surface Hub. Also note the following:
When Surface Hub affiliates with your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, the BitLocker key can be saved in the Active Directory Schema. For more information, see [Prepare your organization for BitLocker: Planning and policies](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/prepare-your-organization-for-bitlocker-planning-and-policies).

Your organization’s Trusted Root CAs are pushed to the same container in Surface Hub, which means you don’t need to import them using a provisioning package.

You can still enroll the device with Intune to centrally manage settings on your Surface Hub.

### Azure Active Directory

When you choose to affiliate your Surface Hub with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), any user with the Global Administrator role can sign in to the Settings app on Surface Hub. You can also configure non Global admin accounts that limit permissions to management of the Settings app on Surface Hub. This enables you to scope admin permissions for Surface Hubs only and prevent potentially unwanted admin access across an entire Azure AD domain.

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Hub Administrator accounts can only sign in to the Settings app when [authenticating via Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn#cloud-authentication).

If you enabled [Intune Automatic Enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enroll#enable-windows-10-automatic-enrollment) for your organization, the Surface Hub will automatically enroll itself with Intune; in this scenario, the account used for Azure AD affiliation during setup must be licensed for Intune and have permissions to enroll Windows devices. After the setup process is completed, the device's BitLocker key is automatically saved in Azure AD.

To learn more about managing Surface Hub with Azure AD, see:

- [Admin group management](admin-group-management-for-surface-hub.md)
- [Configure non Global admin accounts on Surface Hub](surface-hub-2s-nonglobal-admin.md)

### Review and complete Surface Hub setup worksheet (optional)

When you go through the first-run program for your Surface Hub, there's some information that you'll need to supply. The setup worksheet summarizes that info, and provides lists of environment-specific info that you'll need when you go through the first-run program. For more information, see [Setup worksheet](setup-worksheet-surface-hub.md).
