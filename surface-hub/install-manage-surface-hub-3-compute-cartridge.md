# Install and manage Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge

Enjoy the first all-in-one Teams Rooms board running on Windows by seamlessly updating your Surface Hub 2S to Microsoft Teams Rooms with the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge, (formerly Surface Hub 3 Pack). To place an order, contact your [Surface device reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS).

## Install Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge

### Prerequisites

- A Surface Hub 2S, fully updated with the latest Windows Updates. By default, updates are installed automatically during nightly maintenance. To verify, go to **All apps** > **Settings** > **Update and Security** > **Windows Update**, and install all updates.

> [!TIP]
> You may need to restart the device and continue to check for available updates. Ensure the Surface Hub 2S's update history shows **Microsoft Corporation - System Hardware Update - 5/24/2023** or a **System Hardware Update** with any newer date (for example, 3/1/2024).

- An account with admin privileges. You'll need to reset the device if you don't know your username or admin password. For more information, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-recover-reset).
- A resource account with a [supported Microsoft Teams Rooms license](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-licensing).

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge runs Windows 11 IoT Enterprise and does not support downgrading to Windows 10 Team or Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise. (If needed, you can reinstall the old cartridge to resume using Surface Hub 2S).

> [!TIP]
> Since both cartridges appear almost identical, we added two bumps to the edge of the Surface Hub 3 Compute Cartridge cartridge. These bumps are located on the opposite side of the power socket, helping you differentiate between the two models.
