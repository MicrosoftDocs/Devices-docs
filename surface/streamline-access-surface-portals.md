# Streamlining access to Surface Portals for commercial customers

If your organization doesn't have a tenant with Microsoft:

To streamline the onboarding process for customers accessing portals for servicing and supporting Surface devices, we establish two main avenues:

- [Surface Support Portal on Microsoft 365 Admin Center](self-serve-warranty-service.md)
- [Surface Management Portal on Intune Admin Center](surface-management-portal.md)

Both portals require a subscription and the organization's tenant credentials for access. Recognizing that IT Managers might face challenges accessing their organization's tenant information, which can delay onboarding, we introduce an onboarding page.

This onboarding page helps validate the existing Microsoft tenant of the organization's domain. If no tenant exists, it enables IT Administrators/Managers to create a new one for their organization. Once established, this tenant directs them seamlessly to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to access the Surface Support Portal.

## Onboarding process

> [!NOTE]
> This is only applicable to US and Canada customers who do not currently have an Intune or Microsoft 365 subscription.

**Step 1:** Select this [link]() to validate the email and domain of your organization.

Enter the organization's email address. If your organization and domain are already registered with Microsoft, you must sign in with your organizational credentials. In this case, you should contact your IT admin to gain access to these credentials.

If your organization doesn't have a tenant with Microsoft, proceed to **Step 2**.

**Step 2: Setup Account** – Initiate the process of creating a new account with Microsoft.

Provide the business name of your organization, complete address, phone number, and email address you want to associate with your account.

**Step 3: Verify your identity** – Verify your identity through text or a call.

A code is communicated to you to verify your identity. Once your identity is verified, create your credentials with a password.

**Step 4: Add your credentials for access to the Microsoft 365 admin center.**

Save your email and password before moving to the next step. Select **Next** to proceed to the final step.

**Step 5: Add payment details.** This is the final step before you're redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> The payment information links with your account, but you are not charged until you purchase a product from Microsoft. The Surface Support Portal on Microsoft 365 admin center does not require any subscription to access the service for Surface support and service.

After completing the payment information, you're redirected to the Microsoft 365 admin center homepage. Select **Finish**.

Once on the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can request access to the Surface Support Portal.

If your Surface Support Portal access request is rejected or if there's a delay in gaining access, you can still create support orders for your Surface devices by clicking on the help and support node.

To expedite your support request, include your devices serial number and your shipping address in the **Issue Description** field.
