# Surface service options

Most [newer Surface devices](surface-service-and-repair.md) are designed to facilitate repair or replacement of primary components like the solid-state drive (SSD), keyboard, or display. With the purchase of a new commercial Surface for Business device, you can maximize your investment with services and repair options.

If your Surface stops working, you can take advantage of new options to service, repair, or replace components on your device.
 
Every commercial device comes with a minimum 1-year Microsoft Limited Hardware warranty. For added peace of mind, Microsoft Protection Plans offer extended coverage and services that help you with every stage of support you might need for your Surface devices, from deployment to replacement.
 
## In-warranty repair

If you need to service a device that is covered by Microsoft's Limited Hardware Warranty or a Microsoft Protection Plan, we recommend commercial customers open service requests via a self-serve portal:

- **Surface Management Portal:** sign into the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **All services** > **Surface Management Portal**.
- **Hardware Support Portal:** Sign into the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal) and go to **Support** > **Microsoft hardware support**.

(For others with personal devices, sign into your account at [account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices), select the device that needs service, and then select **Start order.)**
 
## Out-of-warranty repair

For devices that are out of warranty, Microsoft offers several options for service or repair:

- **Microsoft in-region repair.** Send devices for repair and return shipping. Create a repair order and mail your device using the prepaid shipping label provided by Microsoft. For details, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).
- **Authorized Service Providers.** Send devices to an Authorized Service Provider (ASP) who performs repairs on Microsoft's behalf. For details, see [Surface repair by Microsoft Authorized Service Providers](authorized-service-providers.md).
- **Customer Self Repair.** Self-repair devices using replaceable components available from device resellers. For details, see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Although these options can also be used for in-warranty repairs, we recommend commercial customers initiate in-warranty support requests via the self-serve portals, listed on this page.
 
> [!TIP]
> Before proceeding with a service request, download the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/fix-common-surface-problems-using-the-surface-app-and-surface-diagnostic-toolkit-f61d8d18-37a9-863d-f8d0-1982eb16f7b5) for automated hardware tests on components including the power supply, battery, display, and sound.
