# Surface service options

Most [newer Surface devices](surface-service-and-repair.md) are designed to facilitate the repair or replacement of primary components like the solid-state drive (SSD), keyboard, or display. With the purchase of a new commercial Surface for Business device, you can maximize your investment with services and repair<sup>1</sup> options.

If your Surface stops working, you can take advantage of new options to service, repair, or replace components on your device.

Every commercial device comes with a minimum 1-year Microsoft Limited Hardware warranty. For added peace of mind, Microsoft Protection Plans<sup>2</sup> offer extended coverage and services that help you with every stage of support you might need for your Surface devices, from deployment to replacement.

## Recommended service options for in-warranty devices

If you need to service a device covered by Microsoft's Limited Hardware Warranty<sup>3</sup> or a Microsoft Protection Plan, we recommend commercial customers open service requests via a self-serve portal. Or if you want to service devices yourself with [self-serve replaceable components](surface-service-and-repair.md), see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Self-serve replaceable components are currently **only available for purchase separately**, independent of the warranty status of your device.

### Surface Management Portal

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **All services** > **Surface Management Portal**.
2. Select **Repair** > **New repair request**. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you need to repair a personal (non-commercial) device, sign into your account at [account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices), choose the device that needs service, and then select **Start order.**

## Recommended service options for out-of-warranty devices

For devices that are no longer covered by Microsoft’s Limited Warranty<sup>3</sup>  or Protection Plan, Microsoft offers several options for service or repair.

- **Customer Self Repair.** Self-repair<sup>1</sup> devices using replaceable components available for purchase from [Authorized Device Resellers](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS). For instructions on how to submit a parts request, see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md). Your product may also be eligible for out-of-warranty service for a fee.<sup>4</sup>
- **Microsoft in-region repair.** Submit a repair request via the [Surface Management Portal](#surface-management-portal) or [Hardware Support Portal](#hardware-support-portal), as described on this page. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).
- **Authorized Service Providers.** Send devices to an Authorized Service Provider (ASP) who performs repairs on Microsoft's behalf. To learn more, see [Surface repair by Microsoft Authorized Service Providers](authorized-service-providers.md).
- **Battery replacement service.** Paid battery replacement service offers are available for: Surface Duo, Surface Laptop 3 (15” & 13.5”), Surface Laptop 4 (15” & 13.5”), Surface Pro 7, Surface Pro 7+, Surface Pro X, Surface Pro 8, Surface Go 2, Surface Go 3, Surface Laptop Go, Surface Book 3, Surface Laptop Studio, Surface Duo 2, and Surface Laptop Go 2.

### References

1. Customer self-repair is only available on Microsoft devices with a removable component per the product’s technical specifications. Microsoft recommends that self-repair be performed by technically inclined individuals with the knowledge, experience and required tools while following the applicable [Surface Service Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440)  or [article](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/replace-the-feet-on-surface-devices-791bcf1d-db4a-4807-816e-06d30072383d). Opening or repairing your device can present various risks, such as electric shock, device damage, fire and personal injury risks, and other hazards. Use caution if undertaking do-it-yourself repairs. Further, any resulting damage caused will not be covered under Microsoft’s Limited Hardware Warranty or purchased protection plan.
2. Additional extended coverage for mechanical breakdown and accidental damage from handling is available through the purchase of a Microsoft Protection Plan. If the plan provides mechanical breakdown coverage,  coverage begins upon expiration of the manufacturer’s original warranty and continues for the remainder of the term shown on the customer's Proof of Purchase. Accidental damage from handling begins immediately upon purchase. Restrictions apply, for all Microsoft Protection Plans, please reference the [terms and conditions](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/warranty-and-protection-plan-terms-conditions-eedf7a23-84a7-1a47-480b-0e10503eedf5) for the applicable limitations of liability and exclusions.
