# Surface service options

Most [newer Surface devices](surface-service-and-repair.md) are designed to facilitate the repair or replacement of primary components like the solid-state drive (SSD), keyboard, or display. With the purchase of a new commercial Surface for Business device, you can maximize your investment with services and repair options.

If your Surface stops working, you can take advantage of new options to service, repair, or replace components on your device.

Every commercial device comes with a minimum 1-year Microsoft Limited Hardware warranty. For added peace of mind, Microsoft Protection Plans offer extended coverage and services that help you with every stage of support you might need for your Surface devices, from deployment to replacement.

## Recommended service options for in-warranty devices

If you need to service a device covered by Microsoft's Limited Hardware Warranty<sup>1</sup> or a Microsoft Protection Plan, we recommend commercial customers open service requests via a self-serve portal. Or if you want to service devices yourself with [self-serve replaceable components](surface-service-and-repair.md), see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Self-serve replaceable components are currently **only available for purchase separately**, independent of the warranty status of your device.

### Surface Management Portal

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **All services** > **Surface Management Portal**.
2. Select **New repair request**. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).

2. Select **New repair request**. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you need to repair a personal (non-commercial) device, sign into your account at [account.microsoft.com/devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices), choose the device that needs service, and then select **Start order.**

## Recommended service options for out-of-warranty devices

For devices that are out of warranty, Microsoft offers several options for service or repair.

- **Customer Self Repair.** Self-repair devices using replaceable components<sup>2</sup> available from [Authorized Device Resellers](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS). For instructions on how to submit a parts request, see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md).
- **Microsoft in-region repair.** Send devices for repair and return shipping. Submit a repair request via the [Surface Management Portal](#surface-management-portal) or [Hardware Support Portal](#hardware-support-portal), as described on this page. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).
- **Authorized Service Providers.** Send devices to an Authorized Service Provider (ASP) who performs repairs on Microsoft's behalf. To learn more, see [Surface repair by Microsoft Authorized Service Providers](authorized-service-providers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> These options--self-repair, in-region repair, or ASP service--can also be used for devices that are still under warranty if desired. For example, you could opt to replace the SSD yourself by following the instructions in [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md). Self-serve replaceable components are currently only **available for purchase separately**, independent of the warranty status of your device. To repair your in-warranty device without the additional cost of obtaining and installing replaceable parts, use the [recommended repair options for in-warranty devices](#recommended-service-options-for-in-warranty-devices) described on this page.
