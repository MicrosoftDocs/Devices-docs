# Surface accessories driver and firmware lifecycle

In response to requests from customers for more detailed lifecycle information to help plan and manage hardware and software deployments, Surface is offering additional guidance on our driver and firmware updates.

This lifecycle policy covers drivers and firmware releases for Surface accessories. The lifecycle begins when an accessory is first released and concludes when Surface ceases publication of drivers and firmware updates on the End of Servicing date. The following sections define the lifecycle policy and End of Servicing dates.

## Surface driver and firmware support lifecycle policy

The Surface Driver and Firmware support period defines the period during which Surface will support driver and firmware updates for an accessory. The Accessory Support Period starts when an accessory is released.

- **For accessories released before January 1, 2021:** Surface accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least 4 years from when the accessory was first released. In cases where the support duration is longer than 4 years, an updated end of servicing date will be published in advance of the date of last servicing.
- **For accessories released on and after January 1, 2021:** Surface accessories will receive driver and firmware updates for at least 6 years from when the accessory was first released. In cases where the support duration is longer than 6 years, an updated end of servicing date will be published in advance of the date of last servicing.
