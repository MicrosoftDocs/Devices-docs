# Surface accessories driver and firmware lifecycle

This page provides essential information about the driver and firmware lifecycle for Surface accessories. The policy outlines the period during which Surface accessories receive driver and firmware updates, starting from the device's initial release until the designated end-of-servicing date when updates are no longer published.

## Overview

The Surface accessories driver and firmware lifecycle period defines the period that updates are available for an accessory. The Accessory Support Period starts when an accessory is released.

- **For accessories released before January 1, 2021:** Surface accessories receive driver and firmware updates for at least four years from when the accessory was first released. In cases where the servicing duration is longer than four years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.
- **For accessories released on and after January 1, 2021:** Surface accessories receive driver and firmware updates for at least six years from when the accessory was first released. In cases where the servicing duration is longer than six years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be published before the date of last servicing.
