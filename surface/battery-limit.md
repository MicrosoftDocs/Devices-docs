# Battery Limit setting

Battery Limit option is a UEFI setting that changes how the Surface device battery is charged and may prolong its longevity. This setting is recommended in  cases  in which the device is continuously connected to power, for example when devices are integrated into kiosk solutions.  

## How Battery Limit works

Setting the device on Battery Limit changes the protocol for charging the device battery. When Battery Limit is enabled, the battery charge will be limited to 50% of its maximum capacity. The charge level reported in Windows will reflect this limit. Therefore, it will show that the battery is charged up to 50% and will not charge beyond  this limit. If you enable Battery Limit while the device is above 50% charge, the Battery icon will show that the device is plugged in but discharging until the device reaches 50% of its maximum charge capacity.  

## Supported devices

The Battery Limit UEFI setting is built into Surface devices by default including:

- Surface Pro 7 and later
- Surface Laptop 3 and later
- Surface Book 3
- Surface Laptop Studio
- Surface Laptop Go
- Surface Laptop Go 2
- Surface Studio 2
- Surface Laptop SE

 Earlier devices require a
 [Surface UEFI firmware update](manage-surface-driver-and-firmware-updates.md), available through Windows Update or via the MSI driver and firmware packages on the [Surface Support site](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface). Check [Enable "Battery Limit" for Surface devices that have to be plugged in for extended periods of time](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4464941) for the specific Surface UEFI version required for each supported device.
