# Surface Pro X app compatibility

Windows 10 and Windows 11 ARM-based PCs help you keep working wherever you go. Here are some of the primary benefits:

- **Always be connected to the internet.** With a cellular data connection, you can be online wherever you get a cellular signal—just like with your mobile phone. When you're at work, home, or by another Wi-Fi network you trust, you can connect to Wi-Fi to save cellular data and keep working.

- **Battery life that goes beyond all-day.**  You'll use less power than you would with other PCs, so you can go through a typical work or school day without running out of battery or worrying about finding a power outlet. If you want to use your PC for something more fun, you can play videos stored on your PC for many hours without charging your battery in between.

- **Turn on instantly.** When you're not using your PC, just press the power button as you do on your mobile phone to turn off the screen. When you take out your PC and turn it back on, it turns on instantly. Whenever you have a few minutes in between classes, meetings, or other activities, you can get things done without waiting for your PC to start.

Note that applications run differently on ARM-based PCs such as Surface Pro X. Limitations include the following:

- **Drivers for hardware, games and apps will only work if designed for a Windows 10 or Windows 11 ARM-based PC**. For more info, check with the hardware manufacturer or the organization that developed the driver. Drivers are software programs that communicate with hardware devices—they're commonly used for antivirus and antimalware software, printing or PDF software, assistive technologies, CD and DVD utilities, and virtualization software. If a driver doesn't work, the app or hardware that relies on it is unlikely to function. Peripherals and devices only work if the drivers they depend on are built into the OS, or if the hardware developer has released ARM64 drivers for the device.
- **Certain games won't work**. Games and apps won't work if they use a version of OpenGL greater than 1.1 or rely on "anti-cheat" drivers that haven't been made for Windows 10 or Windows 11 ARM-based PCs. Check with your game publisher to see if a game will work.
- **Apps that customize the Windows experience might have problems**. This includes input method editors (IMEs), assistive technologies, and cloud storage apps. The organization that develops the app determines whether it will work on a Windows 10 ARM-based PC.
- **Some third-party antivirus software can't be installed**. You won't be able to install some third-party antivirus software on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 ARM-based PC. However, Windows Security will help keep you safe for the supported lifetime of your Windows 10 or Windows 11 device.
- **Windows Fax and Scan is unavailable**. This feature isn't available on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 ARM-based PC.
