# Contact Surface Support for Business and Education customers

## Before you contact us  

Review the [Top Support Solutions for Surface devices](/surface/support-solutions-surface).

Run the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business](surface-diagnostic-toolkit-business.md) (SDT). The SDT enables IT administrators to quickly investigate, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware, software, and firmware issues with Surface devices.

If you're still having a problem after reviewing the top solutions and running the toolkit, use the tabs below to select a support option.
