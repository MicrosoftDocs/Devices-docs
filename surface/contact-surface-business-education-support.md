# Contact Surface Support for Business and Education customers

## Before you contact us  

Review the [Top Support Solutions for Surface devices](/surface/support-solutions-surface).

Run the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business](surface-diagnostic-toolkit-business.md) (SDT). The SDT enables IT administrators to quickly investigate, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware, software, and firmware issues with Surface devices.

If you're still having a problem after reviewing the top solutions and running the toolkit, use the tabs on this page to select a support option.

## [Online support](#tab/online)

Depending on your company's active product subscriptions and/or paid Support offers, convenient solutions are available to manage your Surface device support requests individually and in bulk. Follow the link that best fits your company's profile.

### You manage your devices with Intune

Built into Intune, the Surface Management Portal provides a centralized solution to self-serve, manage, and monitor Surface devices at scale. [Get support](/surface/surface-management-portal).

### You have a Microsoft 365 Subscription

The Microsoft 365 Surface Support Portal provides a self-serve, centralized solution to look up current warranty and protection plans, create service requests, and track the status of device repairs. [Get support](/surface/self-serve-warranty-service).

### You have a Premier or Unified Support contract
