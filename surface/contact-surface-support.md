# Surface Support

### Before you contact us  

Run the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business](surface-diagnostic-toolkit-business.md) (SDT). The SDT enables IT administrators to quickly investigate, troubleshoot, and resolve hardware, software, and firmware issues with Surface devices. You can run a range of diagnostic tests and software repairs in addition to obtaining device health insights and guidance for resolving issues.

If you're still having a problem after running the toolkit, use the tabs below to select a support option.
