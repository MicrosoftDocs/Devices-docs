# Self-serve your Surface warranty & service requests

Microsoft 365 Business customers are eligible to use the Hardware Support Portal to self-serve their Surface devicesâ€™ service requests within Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

The Hardware Support Portal allows you to:

- Add one or multiple devices simultaneously to view current warranty and protection plans.
- Select one or multiple devices to create service requests.
- Track the real-time status of device repairs and transit times.

When you add a Microsoft 365 tenant to the tool, the following Admin roles are granted additional permissions:


| Role                                      | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                 |
