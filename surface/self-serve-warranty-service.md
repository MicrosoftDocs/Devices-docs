# Self-serve your Surface warranty & service requests

Microsoft 365 Business customers are eligible to use the Hardware Support Portal to self-serve their Surface devicesâ€™ service requests within Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

The Hardware Support Portal allows you to:

- Add one or multiple devices simultaneously to view current warranty and protection plans.
- Select one or multiple devices to create service requests.
- Track the real-time status of device repairs and transit times.

When you add a Microsoft 365 tenant to the tool, the following Admin roles are granted additional permissions:

| Role                  | Permissions                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Admin          | View Repair Requests<br>Create/Manage Repair Requests<br>Add/Edit/Delete Ship-to address(es)<br>Create/Manage users and their roles |
| Service Support Admin | View Repair Requests<br>Create/Manage Repair Requests                                                                               |
| Billing Admin         | View Repair Requests<br>Create/Manage Repair Requests<br>Add/Edit/Delete Ship-to address(es)                                        |

## Gain access to the Hardware Support Portal

To access the portal, customers should first sign in to their M365 Admin Center and then register to use the platform using the following link:
[https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/support/microsofthardwaresupport](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/support/microsofthardwaresupport)
