# Manage your Surface warranty & service requests

Commercial customers can submit service requests via a self-serve portal:

- [Surface Support Portal](#surface-support-portal)
- [Surface Management Portal](#surface-management-portal)

## Surface Support Portal

Microsoft 365 Business customers are eligible to use the Surface Support Portal to self-serve their Surface devices’ service requests within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Surface support - Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal#/support/microsoftsurfacesupport).
2. Select **Create service request**. For eligible devices and regional availability, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).

The Surface Support Portal allows you to:

- Add one or multiple devices simultaneously to view current warranty and protection plans.
- Select one or multiple devices to create service requests.
- Track the real-time status of device repairs and transit times.

When you add a Microsoft 365 tenant to the tool, the following Admin roles are granted more permissions:

| Role                                      | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                 |
