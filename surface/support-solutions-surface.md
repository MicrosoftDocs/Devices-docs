# Top support solutions for Surface devices

> [!NOTE]
> **Home users**: This article is only intended for use by IT professionals and technical support agents, and applies only to Surface devices. If you're looking for help with a problem with your home device, please see [Surface Devices Help](https://support.microsoft.com/products/surface-devices).

This page highlights support solutions for common issues you might experience using Surface devices in an enterprise. If your issue isn't listed here, contact [Surface Support for Business and Education customers](https://surface.com/help).

## Warranty and service

### Self-serve via the Surface Support Portal

The portal can be accessed [here](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal#/homepage) and is subject to an initial access authorization.
