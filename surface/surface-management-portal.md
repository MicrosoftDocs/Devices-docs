# Surface Management Portal overview

The Surface Management Portal, integrated into the Microsoft Intune Admin Center, provides a centralized platform to manage and monitor Surface devices at scale. It offers end-to-end visibility, allowing you to address issues before they escalate.

With the Surface Management Portal, you can:

- Gain insights into device compliance, support activity, and warranty coverage.
- Monitor the status of each device, including warranty expirations and active support requests.
- Centralize Surface-specific device administration in a single environment.
- Automatically access comprehensive information from your Intune-enrolled Surface devices, which flows into the Surface Management Portal when users sign in for the first time.
