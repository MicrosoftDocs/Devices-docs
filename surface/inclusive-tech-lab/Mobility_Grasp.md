# Grasp

**The ability to firmly grip or hold an object to use it.**

When we grasp an object, we must be able to wrap our fingers tightly around it. This involves flexibility, muscle strength, and coordination. Grasping a device or its components is essential every day. To use a traditional desktop, we must grasp the mouse. To use a pen or stylus, we must hold it firmly without it slipping. Hand-held devices are also difficult for some people to manipulate. Tablets that are sleek and slippery or devices that are large and cumbersome may be equally difficult to transport and use.

Difficulty grasping objects can be caused by many conditions like arthritis, hand and finger injuries, hand malformations or amputations, decreased strength caused by neurological conditions like muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injuries.

## Barriers

* Small components like charging cords, pens, and mice​
* Activities that require a firm grasp on an object (such as plugging in and pulling out a cord)​
* Devices that are heavy​
* Devices that are sleek or slippery​
* Environments that do not support traditional device use (such as a couch, a bed, or public transit)​

## Facilitators

* Accommodates right and left-handed use​
* Support for alternative input devices (such as pens with built-up grip and assistive technology mice)​
* Options to purchase devices of various sizes and weights​

## Examples

BARRIER — If someone cannot fully grasp a standard Xbox controller, they may be unable to access required buttons and thumbsticks, resulting in exclusion from gameplay.

FACILITATOR — The Xbox Adaptive Controller or other compatible hardware eliminates the need for a specific grasp on the device and allows users to choose inputs that work for them.​
