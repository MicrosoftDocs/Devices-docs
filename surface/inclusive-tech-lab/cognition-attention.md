# Attention

**The ability to concentrate and attend to a task.**

Attention is important for everyday tasks, from concentrating at work to safely driving a car without being distracted by phone notifications. If someone is more sensitive to distractions, it can be difficult to complete a task or enjoy an activity. What is ignored by, or even helpful to, one person may stop another in their tracks. It&apos;s important to consider the balance between the cost of interruption and the benefits of conveying important information to the user. We should strive to give the user tools to manage this balance themself. 

Attention may be impacted by conditions like sensory processing, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a head injury, mental health disabilities, or a learning disability.

## Barriers

* Notifications, sounds, alerts, content on screen, or other visual stimuli that can be annoying or distracting (such as pop-ups, noisy video advertisements, animations, etc.)
* Devices that have loud colors, textures, or features that can be distracting (for example keyboards in bright colors, noisy keyboard keys, trackpad click, etc.)
* Noisy environments which can cause interruptions and lack of focus

## Facilitators

* The ability to mute or hide content that may draw attention away from tasks
* Options to purchase different designs and colors for a device (such as Design Labs, compatible third-party accessories)
* The ability to limit animations and moving objects through software
* Device features which help eliminate environmental distractions (such as noise-canceling features)


## Examples

BARRIER — When there are too many notifications and pop-ups on a screen, it can stop someone in their tracks and take their attention away from the task at hand.

FACILITATOR — The ability to turn off all notifications and pop-ups allows someone to concentrate without having to worry about extraneous distractions.
