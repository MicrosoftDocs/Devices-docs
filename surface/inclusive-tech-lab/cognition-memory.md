# Memory

**The ability to store and recall information when needed.**

We rely on our memory for things like signing into computers and using a device without re-reading instructions. If someone can&apos;t remember their sign-in info and there are no other sign-in options, they may be excluded from an experience from the very beginning. Beyond initial access, when a user interface is familiar and easy to navigate, the user doesn’t have to remember how to get around.

A person’s memory may be impacted by things like head injuries, age-related memory impairments, a stroke, learning disabilities, or mental health conditions.

## Barriers

* Access to an experience or use of a device that relies on memorized information like typed passwords or gestures​

* Experiences that are unfamiliar or don’t have intuitive navigation—requiring memory to complete tasks


## Facilitators

* Options provide alternative means of accessing a device (such as voice or touch identification, facial recognition, biometric access, etc.)​
* User interfaces are simple and provide familiar navigation through an experience (for example, the interface is approachable and provides feedback and guidance in multiple formats)​
* The interface is labeled so that people can easily navigate through an experience as if this was their first time (for example, there are guided video instructions, onscreen prompts)​
* Readily available resources guide a person through an experience if they can't remember how to do so


## Examples

BARRIER — When access to a device requires memorized information, such as a typed password, a person may be excluded from using their device. 


:::image type="content" source="images/cognition-memory-facilitator.jpg" alt-text="The man holds his laptop in front of his face as it scans his facial characteristics to sign him into his account.":::

FACILITATOR — Alternative login options, such as facial recognition, eliminate the need to memorize information and allow people to easily log in to their devices.
