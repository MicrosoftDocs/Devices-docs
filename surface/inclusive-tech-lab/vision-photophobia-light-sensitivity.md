# Photophobia (light sensitivity)

**Intolerance of light, or increased sensitivity to it.**

Devices emit a degree of light that enables users to easily see screen content. For some, this level of brightness can cause irritation or pain. Situational circumstances like having an eye infection or a migraine can cause increased sensitivity to bright lights regardless of environmental lighting. More permanent circumstances that may cause irritation from light include mental health conditions like depression, and eye diseases such as glaucoma or cataracts.

The ability to adjust the brightness of screen lighting or other light sources can optimize the usability of a device for someone experiencing light sensitivity.

## Barriers
* Emittance of light from a device.

## Facilitators
* Brightness can be controlled on screen​
* Alternate methods of increasing screen visibility without increasing brightness (such as high contrast mode, color inversion, etc.)​
* Color temperature can be adjusted (for example, night light)​
* Flashes or flickering on screen can be eliminated


## Examples
