# Judgment

**The ability to make confident decisions while navigating the user experience—regardless of knowledge level, familiarity, language skills, or current concentration level.**

Our judgment helps us make sensible conclusions and decisions. We use our judgment when deciding not to click on a pop-up or hyperlink that may cause a virus, or when choosing where to navigate next. A simple yes/no decision regarding battery life or system security settings can result in lost work or other harmful consequences if someone makes the wrong decision. The design of a product or interface should boost the user&apos;s confidence level and help them make appropriate decisions.

Judgment may be impacted by issues such as a lack of adequate information, anxiety, distractibility, brain injuries that affect the ability to process information, learning disabilities, or memory loss.

## Barriers

* The experience lacks corrective feedback when navigating an interface or device
* The experience lacks consistency or predictability (for example, if it's a button, it should look and act like a button)
* The experience offers too many stimuli and complicated choices (such as video or sound playing in the background, confusing navigation, functionality that’s hidden or buried in too many clicks)

## Facilitators

* Experiences and hardware components that are intuitive, consistent with user expectations and design behaviors, and easy to navigate 
* Clear instructions that accommodate a wide range of literacy and comprehension skills​
* Effective prompting and feedback (such as warnings of hazards and errors, or prompts asking questions like “Are you sure you want to delete?”)
* Elements are arranged consistently to minimize errors (for example, frequently used and safe elements are prominent; hazardous elements are eliminated or isolated)

## Examples

BARRIER — Lack of corrective feedback when deciding whether to increase screen brightness without being plugged in to a power source can result in lost work and frustration.

FACILITATOR — Notifications that warn of hazards can eliminate the cognitive demands of identifying negative consequences before adjusting device settings.
