# Inclusive Tech Lab

The Inclusive Tech Lab is a Microsoft program dedicated to inclusive design. Our facility is for people with disabilities, not about people with disabilities. It has been crafted to be an expression of Microsoftâ€™s commitment to the accessibility community and our NGO partners.

We have had over 7000 visitors (Microsoft employees, partners, and guests - including over 1500 students) visit the lab where we introduce them to the social model of disability. We explore how people with disabilities work or play, how they want to represent themselves and interact online, and what they need to truly have fun and be productive. For many of our visitors it is a perspective changing experience.

We strive to encourage designers and engineers to intentionally include people with disabilities in the products and services they create. We host introductory tours, collaborative workshops, and inclusive design sprints with teams and studios to inspire and facilitate inclusion in their work.
