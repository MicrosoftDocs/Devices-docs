# Speech quality

**The clarity, fluency, and volume of speech.**

The quality of our speech can be diminished by cognitive and mobility factors that affect the pronunciation of our words—such as stuttering, slurring, or mumbling. Speech quality can be affected by long pauses between words or speaking too swiftly. If a person has a weak diaphragm or weak mouth muscles, they may not be able to speak at a volume loud or forceful enough to be detected by a device. Exclusion occurs when a device can’t understand unclear or quiet diction.

People with mobility limitations often use voice activated devices and features. This allows independence in performing tasks, allowing them to give voice commands without physical interaction. When someone isn’t understood by their device, they may be unable to use it to promote their independence.

Diminished speech quality can be caused by temporary situations like nervousness, anxiety, or a sore throat. It can also be influenced by permanent situations like cognitive disabilities or conditions that affect mobility and coordination.

## Barriers
* Speech recognition that is sensitive to error (for example, when speech recognition can't pick up repeated words or handle unclear pronunciations, accents, stuttering, long pauses, etc.)​
* Speech recognition that isn't able to pick up low volume or force of voice​

## Facilitators
* Support for microphones that enhance voice input​
* Devices and software which are more forgiving of errors during speech input​
* Support for microphones that enhance voice input​
* Ability to detect voice input at a low volume (for example, turning up sensitivity of device microphone)

## Examples

BARRIER—When a speech recognition program can’t understand speech that isn’t perfectly concise or accurate, such as stutters or repeated words, it may exclude people.

FACILITATOR—Speech recognition programs that can detect and correct errors in speech allow the user to complete tasks without having to manually correct errors.
