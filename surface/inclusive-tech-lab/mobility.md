# What is mobility?

There are many aspects of mobility that affect the way someone uses a device. Our anatomy and muscles give us our mobility, and they rely on brain signals which control the muscles. Mobility ranges from being able to perform gross movements with the arms and legs (like walking or reaching for things), to fine movements like writing with a pen, typing on a keyboard, or using a touch screen with a single pointer finger. When it’s difficult to use big or small muscles in a coordinated, smooth, and intentional manner, it may be difficult to navigate an experience.

Mobility can be influenced by situational, temporary, progressive, or permanent conditions.

**[Grasp](mobility-grasp.md)** &mdash; Does the experience require holding or manipulating small components (such as a charging cord, pen, etc.)?

**[Fine motor skills](mobility-fine-motor-skills.md)** &mdash; Does the experience require intricate movements of the hands or fingers?

**[Coordination](mobility-coordination.md)** &mdash; Is the experience forgiving when people are unable to perform smooth, fluid movements, or if they lack accuracy?

**[Control (voluntary vs. involuntary movement)](mobility-control.md)** &mdash; Can tasks be completed while a person is affected by involuntary or unintentional movements?

**[Speed](mobility-speed.md)** &mdash; Does the experience require that tasks be completed at a certain speed for the user to be successful?

**[Muscle tone](mobility-muscle-tone.md)** &mdash; Does task performance require the use of both arms or hands through a wide range of motion?

**[Endurance](mobility-endurance.md)** &mdash; Does the experience require specific motions for a prolonged period?

**[Posture](mobility-posture.md)** &mdash; Does use of the device or input components require that a person’s body maintain a certain position during the experience (such as sitting upright at a desk to use a standard mouse)?
