# Processing (comprehension)

**The degree to which someone can understand and learn information.**

A person’s comprehension skills may determine how they understand new information. Step-by-step instructions that seem simple for one person may be difficult for someone else with different learning preferences. All content (instructions, feedback, design, titles, headings, etc.) should accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.

A person’s ability to understand information also depends on their ability to see, hear, or perceive it. If someone can’t read the text size on the quick start guide, they could be excluded before even having the opportunity to process the information. If someone can’t comprehend instructions, the user interface can still facilitate use by providing fail-safe features and symbolic representation of information. The extent and level of comprehension can be influenced by things like dyslexia and dyscalculia, learning disabilities, or difficulty obtaining and interpreting information due to vision or hearing loss.

## Barriers
* Text that is complex, too lengthy, or cumbersome to read through​
* Experiences and usage requirements that aren’t intuitive, straightforward, or familiar​

## Facilitators

* The user interface or experience is intuitive, new learning is minimized​
* Content or instructions presented in written, audio, or video format are clear and written at lower secondary education level
* Elements are arranged consistently to minimize errors (for example, frequently used, safe elements are prominent and hazardous elements are eliminated or isolated)​
* Content is available in a variety of ways (such as with pictures, symbol format, written format, audio format)


## Examples

BARRIER — Instruction guides that are lengthy or primarily text-based can be difficult to follow or understand.

FACILITATOR — People with all levels of comprehension and reading abilities are included when there are simple pictures and diagrams. This addition can make instructions easier to follow.
