# Barriers to accessibility can co-occur

**Disabilities seldom happen in isolation. A person’s disability may impact their technology use in many ways.**

Certain conditions, like a stroke, can impact a person in various ways. They may have impaired coordination and a degree of paralysis. In addition, they may be affected cognitively, experience aphasia, and have difficulties with processing and memory. A stroke can also cause blind spots or visual field loss. Some, or all, of these conditions may be permanent. Conversely, a stroke may only impact one of these areas and it may resolve over a short period of time.

Designing for co-occurring barriers can empower people to achieve more.

Examples of multiple types of disabilities occurring simultaneously: 

* Cerebral palsy—Cerebral palsy can affect a person in various ways from mild to profound degrees of severity. While one person may be able to walk on their own, another may need to use a wheelchair for mobility. Coordination, fine motor skills, vision, and cognitive functions may also be affected. Someone with cerebral palsy may also have difficulty with producing clear speech or producing speech loud enough for a speaker device to detect. In mild forms of cerebral palsy, a person may only experience one or two minor effects of the condition.

* Autism—The symptoms of autism vary widely. Some people with autism are verbal and can communicate well, while others are nonverbal. Some can be hypersensitive to sensory stimuli. Others may not detect even very intense sensory stimuli. On the other end of the spectrum, a person with autism may not have any sensory deficits at all.

* Cataracts—Cataracts are a clouding or loss of transparency in the eye, which may cause overall decreased acuity or spots in the visual field. In some cases, cataracts can cause color blindness. As a result, cataracts not only affect vision, but may affect someone’s coordination and accuracy because they have trouble seeing what they are interacting with. Symptoms can also include double or blurred vision, sensitivity to light, and screen glare. 

* Multiple conditions—A person with cataracts could also have arthritis that limits their mobility or diminished hearing due to advanced aging.
