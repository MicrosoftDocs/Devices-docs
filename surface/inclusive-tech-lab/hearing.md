# What is hearing?

Receiving and interpreting sound is another way in which we inform our decisions and actions. For someone with hearing loss, exclusion occurs when information is conveyed only through sound. Degrees of hearing loss vary across a wide spectrum, causing different types of barriers to everyday technology use. As a result, solutions to these barriers must also be varied and allow the user to choose what is most appropriate for them. For example, someone with moderate hearing loss may benefit from using their Bluetooth enabled hearing aids as a means of hearing video content instead of only having the option of reading closed captioning.

**[Mild](hearing-mild.md)** &mdash; Does use of the device rely on a full range of hearing (such as when there are inadequate settings for volume control)?

**[Moderate/Severe](hearing-moderate-severe.md)** &mdash; Does the experience support the use of hearing aids?

**[Profound](hearing-profound.md)** &mdash; Does the experience rely on hearing to complete a task?

**[Asymmetrical](hearing-asymmetrical.md)** &mdash; Does the experience use only one type of auditory output (such as when there’s no adjustment for unilateral and bilateral output)?
