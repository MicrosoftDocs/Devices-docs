# What is sensation and perception?

Sensation is our ability to detect senses like touch, pain, vision, or the movement and positioning of our body. Perception is the way in which the brain processes and communicates these senses to the rest of the body. Some may have difficulty detecting sensation at all due to skin integrity or anatomical factors. Others can detect sensation, however, the way their brain processes sensory input may not be perceived accurately. For example, some people are more sensitive to vestibular input, such as spinning or motion, than others. Two people may be spinning the same amount of time and at the same speed, but only one of the two gets sick.

This principle can be applied to things like perception of pain, or perception of touch in general. Someone who is hyperresponsive to touch may be annoyed by certain fabrics or textures of objects, while someone who is under responsive to touch may not realize their skin is becoming irritated from brushing up against the edge of their keyboard. The ability to sense stimuli is different than the way the body interprets it.

Regardless, a variance in either of these two processes may result in exclusion or discomfort during product experience.

**[Vestibular](sensation-perception-vestibular.md)** &mdash; Does the experience emit sounds, vibrations, or visual stimuli?

**[Chronic pain](sensation-perception-chronic-pain.md)** &mdash; Does the user have to position their body in a specific way in order to use the product (such as the grasp required for a standard Xbox controller)?

**[Skin integrity](sensation-perception-skin-integrity.md)** &mdash; Does the user have to make physical contact with the product?

**[Sensation (hypersensitive and hyposensitive)](sensation-perception-sensation.md)** &mdash; Does the experience emit sensory stimuli (such as sights, sounds, haptics, physical touch)?

**[Proprioception](sensation-perception-proprioception.md)** &mdash; Does the product require physical contact in order to use it?
