This plan is only offered in Australia at this time.

## Customer eligibility

EHS Plus with On-Site is a commercial Protection Plan available for purchase by enterprise customers, including educational institutions, through a [Microsoft-authorized reseller.](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface).<sup>2</sup>

### Eligible devices (commercial versions only)
