# Processing (speed)

**The amount of time it takes someone to perceive information (visibly, audibly, or physically), process it, and produce a response.**

People process information at different speeds, depending on their situation. This includes scenarios such as the time lapse between seeing oncoming traffic, comprehending the presence of it, and deciding to wait until a car has fully passed before pulling onto the street. When the ability to process information isn’t as fast as the time allotted to produce a response, the user may experience undesired consequences.

The speed in which someone processes information can be influenced by fatigue, learning disabilities, a traumatic brain injury or stroke, hearing or vision loss, and many other factors.

## Barriers

* Timed responses that result in undesired consequences if people don’t act in the allotted time (for example, the computer will restart in 60 seconds unless you click “cancel”)
* Voice-activated experiences that “stop listening” after a designated amount of time (for example, Cortana, dictation, etc.)

## Facilitators

* The ability to eliminate timed responses
* Timed response notifications that give the user clear actions to take
* Simple and direct options that allow the user to extend a timed response (for example, “Remind me later” or “snooze”)

## Examples

![A woman looks at her tablet’s screen as she sits in a wheelchair. She is trying to quickly press a digital pen against the tablet as she watches TV.](/images/Cognition_ProcessingSpeed_Barrier.jpg)

BARRIER — Prompts requiring a person to read, interpret, and act within a time limit can result in lost work if a person cannot meet those expectations.

FACILITATOR — The ability to eliminate timed responses allows the user to react to prompts at their own pace, without having to worry about negative consequences.
