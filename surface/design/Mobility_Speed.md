# Speed

**The ability to perform an action at the necessary rate before the time limit has expired.**

Speed of movement is characterized by both the amount of time it takes to initiate the movement and the amount of time it takes to complete the movement. Difficulty performing tasks at a high speed can make interaction with devices difficult and cumbersome. For example, slow hand movements can make typing a single sentence into a long, arduous process. Gestures that require swift movements such as “swiping up” to unlock the screen may exclude access to users who can’t perform this motion at such a speed.

Slow movements can be caused by any kind of condition that affects movement or coordination—fatigue, neurological conditions like Parkinson’s or cerebral palsy, injuries to the brain or spinal cord, and injuries to hands and fingers.


## Barriers
* Gestures that require swift, fluid motions to complete a task (such as touch screen gestures, gestural input with HoloLens)​
* Tasks that require performing two actions simultaneously (such as holding down FN and F1 to turn on a shortcut, sticky keys)​
* Actions that require repetitive motions (such as typing, double-clicking)​
* Timed responses which expire if action isn’t taken before the allotted time is up​

## Facilitators

* Support for alternate inputs that supplement speed (such as dictation instead of typing)​
* Support for altered accessibility settings (such as increasing mouse cursor movement speed)​
* Settings that eliminate or elongate timed responses​


## Examples

![A woman sits in a wheelchair and holds a tablet on her lap. She’s looking down while typing on the touchscreen, and she looks stressed.](images/)

BARRIER — Tasks like typing on a keyboard can be time consuming and strenuous for someone who can't move their fingers at a fast pace.

![The tablet screen shows an onscreen keyboard, and someone has typed &quot;I’m&quot; without including the apostrophe.](images/)

FACILITATOR — Support for features like predictive text can decrease the physical demands of typing and allow someone to perform a task at a faster rate.
