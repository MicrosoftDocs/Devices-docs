# Non-verbal

**Not using spoken language or words.**

Non-verbal communication can be due to a speech limitation or to personal choice. Nearly one third of people on the autism spectrum don’t use spoken language or use very few words. Other people use spoken language, but in a party chat during video game play, they may simply wish to refrain from using spoken language so they don’t reveal their gender or age. Also, varying degrees of hearing loss can result in an inability to hear one’s voice when speaking out loud. When someone is unable to hear their own voice, they may be unsure about the pace, volume, and clarity in which they're speaking to others; those with hearing loss may choose not to communicate verbally.

Support for alternative methods of input outside of spoken language should be considered when designing devices and experiences that require communication between users. This can be in the form of text-to-speech capability for video game play or conference calls, support for written chat platforms, or even support for video sign-language-to-speech programs.

## Barriers
* Actions that use voice during an experience (for example, live chat on a gaming platform, voice commands)​
* Work-related tasks like conference calls or other verbal communication-based tasks

## Facilitators
* Support for live chat options isn’t dependent on verbal/speech input (such as written chat platforms)​
* Communication devices that represent words using pictures (such as system support for software applications like &quot;MyTalkTools&quot; and &quot;Predictable&quot;)​
* Sign-language interpretation (either human or avatar)

## Examples

![A man is sitting at his computer. The window open on his screen shows that he is on a video call with four other people. He is typing on the keyboard.](/images/Communication_Non_Verbal_Barrier.jpg)

BARRIER — During video calls, chat functions may get hidden. If a person communicates during video calls through text only, their input may not be received by others in a timely manner. 

![A woman is sitting at her computer. The window open on her screen shows that she is on a video call with four other people. There is a message on her screen that reads: &quot;[Nyle] has sent a new chat&quot;](/images/Communication_Non_Verbal_Facilitator.jpg)

FACILITATOR — A notification that lets other people on the video call know that someone has sent a chat message ensures that everyone is able to participate in the video call.
