# Surface devices driver and firmware lifecycle

This page provides essential information on the driver and firmware lifecycle for Windows-based Surface devices, designed to assist IT admins in effectively planning and managing their hardware and software deployment strategies.

This policy outlines the lifecycle of driver and firmware updates for all Surface devices, including Surface for Business and Consumer devices. It runs from the initial release of a device until the designated end-of-servicing date when Surface ceases to publish updates. 

## Overview

The Surface driver and firmware lifecycle consists of two parts: 

- The [driver and firmware servicing period](#device-servicing-period) for a device. 
- The [support provided for OS versions](#os-version-support) during that period.

The device servicing period refers to the timeframe in which Surface devices receive firmware and driver updates, ensuring the hardware remains optimized for supported operating systems.

### Device servicing period

The Surface driver and firmware servicing period defines how long updates are provided for a device.

- **For devices released before January 1, 2021:** Surface devices will receive driver and firmware updates for at least four years from when the device was first released. If the servicing period exceeds four years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be announced before the final update.

- **For devices released on and after January 1, 2021:** Surface devices will receive driver and firmware updates for at least six years from when the device was first released. If the servicing period exceeds six years, an updated end-of-servicing date will be announced before the final update.

For accessories, see [Surface accessories driver and firmware lifecycle](surface-accessories-driver-firmware-lifecycle-support.md).

### OS version support

OS version support defines the operating system versions Surface supports during the device servicing period. Surface devices receive driver and firmware updates for Windows OS versions released in the prior 30 months. Surface devices won't support Windows OS versions older than the version supported at their release.  To see the minimum supported OS version for your Surface device, visit [Surface supported operating systems](surface-supported-operating-systems.md).

If your deviceâ€™s OS version is no longer supported, we recommend upgrading to the latest available OS to continue receiving driver and firmware updates.

Once the device servicing period is concluded, devices continue to receive Windows OS feature and security updates per the Windows Lifecycle Policy as described on the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy support page](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338/microsoft-lifecycle-policy).
