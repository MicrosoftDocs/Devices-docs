## Enhanced security and risk mitigation

The smart card reader, included on select versions of 15" models<sup>1</sup>, delivers enhanced security via its implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA). By requiring both a physical card and a PIN, the smart card reader minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, protecting against sophisticated cyber threats, including phishing and social engineering attacks.

## Common Access Card (CAC) support

The smart card reader is specifically designed to read the [Common Access Card](https://www.cac.mil/common-access-card/) (CAC), which is a specialized form of smart card used by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The CAC provides secure two-factor authentication for active-duty military personnel, reserve personnel, civilian employees, and eligible contractor personnel.
The smart card reader in Surface Laptop 6 facilitates authorized users with access to DoD computers, networks, and certain DoD facilities, and it can also encrypt and sign emails.

## Compliance and regulatory adherence

For organizations operating in sectors where regulatory compliance is stringent (e.g., government, defense, healthcare, and finance), the smart card reader helps meet strict access control and data protection requirements. It helps ensure organizations adhere to laws and regulations such as HIPAA, FISMA, and GDPR, which mandate strong authentication measures to protect sensitive data. This compliance is not just about avoiding penalties but also about demonstrating to stakeholders and customers a commitment to maintaining high security and privacy standards.

## Operational efficiency and access management

Implementing a smart card reader streamlines access management across the organization. It simplifies the process of granting or revoking access rights, enhances user experience by consolidating multiple credentials into a single authentication mechanism, and supports a secure mobile workforce. This centralized access management improves operational efficiency, reduces administrative overhead, and enhances the overall security posture by ensuring consistent application of access policies.
