# Maximizing your ROI from Microsoft 365 Enterprise with Microsoft Surface

 To improve employee experience across their entire organizations, firms are looking to replace legacy device technologies with more flexible hardware solutions and cloud technologies that lend themselves to modern work environments, where employees can remain productive, communicative, and secure from any location. Microsoft commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study to examine the potential return on investment (ROI) enterprises may realize by implementing Microsoft 365 Enterprise on Microsoft Surface devices, looking closely at how Microsoft Surface augments and compounds the business benefits of Microsoft 365. The purpose of this study is to provide readers with a framework to evaluate the potential financial impact of Microsoft 365-powered Surface devices on their organizations.
