# Surface System SKU reference

This document provides a reference that can be used for various IT tasks such as executing commands or installing drivers based on device model/SKU names. 
System Model and System SKU are variables stored in System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) tables in the UEFI layer of Surface devices. Use the System SKU name whenever you need to differentiate between devices with the same System Model name, such as Surface Pro and Surface Pro with LTE Advanced. SKUs listed in the following table refer to commercial devices unless labeled as Consumer. 

| Device   | System Model | System SKU       |

## Examples

**Retrieving the SKU by using PowerShell**  
Use the following PowerShell command to pull the System SKU information:

 ```powershell  
(Get-CimInstance -Namespace root\wmi -ClassName MS_SystemInformation).SystemSKU
```

**Retrieving the SKU by using System Information**  
You can also find the System SKU and System Model for a device in **System Information**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select **Start**, and then type **MSInfo32** in the search box.  
1. Select **System Information**.

**Using the SKU in a task sequence WMI condition**  
You can use the System SKU information in the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager as part of a task sequence WMI condition.

 ```console 
    - WMI Namespace – Root\WMI
    - WQL Query – SELECT * FROM MS_SystemInformation WHERE SystemSKU = "Surface_Pro_1796"
 ```
