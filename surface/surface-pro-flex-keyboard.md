## Highlights

The new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard enhances flexibility:

- **Versatile design:** The Surface Pro Flex Keyboard is designed for new experiences, functioning both attached and detached.
- **Seamless transition:** Effortlessly pair and switch throughout your day. Use it attached to your Pro for the ultimate laptop setup or detach<sup>1</sup> it to serve as a standalone keyboard for greater flexibility.
- **Ergonomic workspaces:** Dock Surface Pro to a monitor to create an optimal productivity setup.
- **Creative workflows:** Enhance your creativity by using your Slim Pen<sup>2</sup> with Surface Pro in one hand and accessing essential Adobe shortcuts with Surface Pro Flex Keyboard in the other.
- **Adaptable to any space:** Surface Pro Flex Keyboard excels even in cramped spaces, like an airplane seat. Detach and continue working comfortably, maintaining your workflow wherever you are.
- **Encrypted**: 128-bit encryption technology encrypts your data and only allows your Surface Pro to decrypt it, making it difficult for a cyber-thief to intercept your keystrokes.

### Connectivity

The Surface Pro Flex Keyboard features Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> Low Energy (LE) technology. For earlier Surface Pro devices without Bluetooth LE support, the Surface Pro Flex Keyboard can still maintain connectivity through standard Bluetooth protocols, helping ensure seamless integration. 

Surface Pro Flex Keyboard supports wireless connectivity to one Surface Pro device. To switch to another device:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Bluetooth & devices** and remove **Surface Pro Flex Keyboard** as an input device. 
2. Physically disconnect the keyboard.
3. Press and hold the **Esc** key for about 5 seconds until the **Fn** key LED light turns on.
4. Physically connect the keyboard to your other Surface Pro device.
