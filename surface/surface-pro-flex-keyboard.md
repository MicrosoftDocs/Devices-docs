The new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard enhances flexibility:

- **Versatile design:** The Surface Pro Flex Keyboard is designed for new experiences, functioning both attached and detached.

- **Ergonomic workspaces:** Dock Surface Pro to a monitor to create an optimal productivity setup.
- **Creative workflows:** Enhance your creativity by using your pen<sup>2</sup> with Surface Pro in one hand and accessing essential Adobe shortcuts with Surface Pro Flex Keyboard in the other.
