# Advanced Exchange replacement for Surface devices

Some commercial Microsoft Surface products and extended protection plans come with Advanced Exchange. If Microsoft determines your device needs to be replaced, you can replace your device with Advanced Exchange. For more information, review [Warranty and Protection Plan Terms & Conditions](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/warranty-and-protection-plan-terms-conditions-eedf7a23-84a7-1a47-480b-0e10503eedf5).

## How it works

1. Please perform diagnostic testing using the automated [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business](surface-diagnostic-toolkit-business.md). You may have the option to have your device replaced. 
1. Microsoft immediately ships you a replacement device with a prepaid return shipping label before receiving your original defective product.
1. Return your original defective product to Microsoft within 10 calendar days after you receive the replacement device.
1. If possible, ensure all data is backed up and removed before returning your defective product to Microsoft. To learn more, see [Backup and Restore in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/352091d2-bb9d-3ea3-ed18-52ef2b88cbef). Microsoft is not responsible for any loss of data during servicing.    
1. Return your original product using the box and prepaid shipping label that comes with your replacement device. If you fail to return your original Surface device within 10 days, you will be assessed Microsoft's retail price of the device plus a shipping & handling fee.  

> [!NOTE]
> Allow an average of 3-5 days to receive your replacement device. Times may vary based on location and product availability.

Commercial products or scenarios not covered by the Microsoft Limited Hardware Warranty or a Microsoft Extended Protection Plan are not eligible for Advanced Exchange replacement. 

> [!TIP]
> To confirm your coverage status, refer to the [Check Warranty Self-Service Portal](https://mybusinessservice.surface.com/CheckWarranty/CheckWarranty). For out-of-warranty exchange information and pricing, see [Microsoft's out-of-warranty service cost](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/how-much-does-out-of-warranty-service-cost-for-your-surface-device-or-accessory-4c77ac8a-e8c3-d0e4-7e8a-a29f768d43ff).
