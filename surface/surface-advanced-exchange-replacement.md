# Surface Advanced Exchange Replacement for Surface devices

Some commercial Microsoft Surface products and extended protection plans come with Advanced Exchange. For more information, please review Microsoft's [terms and conditions](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/warranty-and-protection-plan-terms-conditions-eedf7a23-84a7-1a47-480b-0e10503eedf5).

If, through diagnostics, Microsoft determines your device needs to be replaced â€“ you may choose to have your device replaced through the Advanced Exchange process.

1. Microsoft will ship you a replacement before receiving your original defective product.
2. The advanced exchange replacement will be shipped to you in a box with the prepaid return shipping label.
3. Your original defective product must be returned to Microsoft within ten (10) calendar days from delivery of the replacement product.
4. If possible, ensure all data is backed up and removed before returning your defective product to Microsoft.
    - Microsoft is not responsible for the loss of data during servicing. For more information about backing up your files, please visit [Backup and Restore in Windows (microsoft.com)](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/352091d2-bb9d-3ea3-ed18-52ef2b88cbef)
5. Return your original product using the box and prepaid shipping label that comes with your replacement product. If you do not ship your original Microsoft Surface series device back within ten days from the date Microsoft ships you the Advanced Exchange replacement, you will be assessed a fee equal to Microsoft's retail price of the Advanced Exchange device plus a shipping &  handling fee.  

The average time to receive your replacement product using advanced exchange is 3-5 calendar days. Times may vary based on location and product availability.
Commercial products or scenarios not covered by Microsoft's Standard Limited Hardware Warranty or a Microsoft Extended Protection Plan are not eligible for advanced exchange replacement. Customers can check the coverage status of a Microsoft product using the [Check Warranty Self-Service Portal](https://mybusinessservice.surface.com/en-AU/CheckWarranty/CheckWarranty). For out-of-warranty exchange information and pricing, please visit [Microsoft's out-of-warranty service cost](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/how-much-does-out-of-warranty-service-cost-for-your-surface-device-or-accessory-4c77ac8a-e8c3-d0e4-7e8a-a29f768d43ff).
