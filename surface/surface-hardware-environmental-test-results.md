# Surface hardware environmental test results

Surface devices are built to withstand rigorous conditions that help ensure optimal reliability and lower cost of ownership.

:::image type="content" source="images/surface-family.png" alt-text="Surface device family" :::

The MIL-STD-810 test standards, maintained by the US Department of Defense, help organizations evaluate how devices perform in the field. The testing program outlines multiple test methods across a range of environmental stress conditions. This is designed to test equipment limits in various conditions where it's expected to be used (environment) or transported (shocks). An independent third-party laboratory has tested the Surface devices listed below using recommended test methods. 

## MIL-STD-810 test results

Operational tests pass if the unit remained operational during the entire test, and non-operational tests pass if a functional verification was performed immediately after the test exposure. Tests were conducted in accordance with the MIL-STD-810 standards effective at the time of product release. The latest Surface devices – Surface Pro 9, Surface Pro 9 with 5G, Surface Laptop 5, and Surface Laptop Go 2 – meet the current standard, MIL-STD-810H.  Earlier devices were tested under the previous standard, MIL-STD-810G.
