# Microsoft in region same unit repair

Microsoft can repair many commercial Surface devices via in-region repair facilities. If eligible for mail-in repair services, you can ship the device to Microsoft for repair and return. Once your device is received, it will undergo diagnostic tests to determine any appropriate repairs. (If no issues are found, Microsoft will return your device to you un-repaired).

Upon successful repair, Microsoft will return your device to your specified shipping address. Average turnaround time ranges from 6-12 calendar days, and may vary depending on your location and supply chain availability. This process, known as "Same Unit Repair," is offered for the following devices in the countries listed below.

- Surface Laptop 3 – 13" and 15"
- Surface Laptop 4 – 13" and 15"
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Laptop Go
- Surface Go
- Surface Pro X
