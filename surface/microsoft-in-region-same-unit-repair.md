# Microsoft in region same unit repair

Microsoft can repair many commercial Surface devices via in-region repair facilities. If troubleshooting or diagnostics determine that your Surface device needs repair and is eligible for mail-in repair services, you can ship it to Microsoft for repair and return.

To iniitiate a request, open service requests via a self-serve portal:

- **Hardware Support Portal:** Sign into the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal) and go to **Show all** > **Support** > **Microsoft hardware support**.

Upon successful repair, Microsoft returns the device to your shipping
