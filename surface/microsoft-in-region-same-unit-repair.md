# Microsoft in region same unit repair

Microsoft can repair many commercial Surface devices via in-region repair facilities. If troubleshooting or diagnostics determine that your Surface device needs repair and is eligible for mail-in repair services, you can ship it to Microsoft for repair and return.

> [!NOTE]
> Allow an average of 6-8 days to receive your replacement device. Times may vary based on location and product availability.

## Open service request

To initiate service, open a request via a self-serve portal:

- **Surface Management Portal:** Sign into the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and go to **All services** > **Surface Management Portal**. Select **New repair request**.
- **Microsoft Hardware Support Portal:** Sign into the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal) and go to **Show all** > **Support** > **Microsoft hardware support**. Select **New repair request**.

Upon successful repair, Microsoft returns the device to your shipping
address. Average turnaround time is 6-12 calendar days depending on your location and supply chain availability.
