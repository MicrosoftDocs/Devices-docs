### Offline and on-device access for more productive experiences

Traditionally, VDI solutions only work when the endpoint is connected to the internet. But what happens when the internet or power is unavailable?

To support business continuity and help employees be productive, Microsoft designed Surface devices to augment the virtual desktop experience with offline access to files, Microsoft 365 and third-party applications. Traditional apps like Microsoft Office, available across multiple platforms (x86, x64, Universal Windows Platform, ARM), enable users to stay productive in offline mode. Files from the virtual desktop cloud environment can be synced locally on Surface using OneDrive for Business for offline access. You can be confident that all locally cached information is up-to-date and secure.

In addition to adding support for offline access to apps and files, Surface devices are designed to optimize collaborative experiences like Microsoft Teams "On-Device." Although some VDI solutions support the use of Teams through a virtual session, users can benefit from the more optimized experience provided by a locally installed instance of Teams. Localizing communications and collaboration apps for multimedia channels like voice, video, live captioning allows organizations to take full advantage of Surface devices' ability to provide optimized Microsoft 365 experiences. The emergence of AI brings new capabilities to life on compatible devices, such as eye gaze technology that adjusts the appearance of your eyes, so the audience sees you looking directly at the camera when communicating via video.

An alternative to locally installing traditional applications is to take advantage of the latest version of Microsoft Edge, which comes with support for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). PWAs are just websites that are progressively enhanced to function like native apps on supporting platforms. The qualities of a PWA combine the best of the web and native apps with additional features, such as push notifications, background data refresh, offline support, and more.

### Virtual GPUs

GPUs are ideal for AI compute and graphics-intensive workloads, helping customers to fuel innovation through scenarios like high-end remote visualization, deep learning, and predictive analytics. However, this isn't ideal for professionals who need to work remotely or on the go because varying degrees of internal GPU horsepower are tied to the physical devices, limiting mobility and flexibility.

To solve this, Azure offers the N-series family of Virtual Machines with NVIDIA GPU capabilities (vGPU). With vGPUs, IT can either share GPU performance across multiple virtual machines or power-demanding workloads by assigning multiple GPUs to a single virtual machine. For Surface, this means that no matter what device you're using, from Surface Go 4 to Surface Laptop 6, your device has access to powerful server-class graphics performance. Surface and vGPUs allow you to combine all the things you love about Surface, including pen, touch, keyboard, trackpad and PixelSense displays, with graphics capability only available in high-performance computing environments.

Azure N-series brings these capabilities to life on your Surface device, allowing you to work in any way you want, wherever you go. [Learn more about Azure N-Series and GPU-optimized virtual machine sizes.](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu)

## Microsoft 365 and Surface

Even in a virtualized desktop environment, Microsoft 365 and Surface deliver the experiences employees love, the protection organizations demand, and flexibility for teams to work their way. According to [Forrester Research](forrester-tei-study.md): <a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>

- Microsoft 365-powered Surface devices give users up to five hours in weekly productivity gains with up to nine hours saved per week for highly mobile workers, providing organizations with 112 percent ROI on Microsoft 365 with Surface.
- Seventy-five percent agree Microsoft 365-powered Surface devices help improve employee satisfaction and retention.

### Security and management

From chip to cloud, Microsoft 365 and Surface helps organizations stay protected and up to date.
With Surface hardware and software — designed, built, and tested by Microsoft — users can be confident they're productive and protected by leading technologies from chip to cloud. As more users work remotely, corporate data and intellectual property protection become more paramount than ever. Azure Virtual Desktop on Surface is designed around a zero-trust security model. Every access request is strongly authenticated, authorized within policy constraints, and inspected for anomalies before granting access.

By maximizing efficiencies from cloud computing, modern management enables IT to better serve the needs of users, stakeholders and customers in an increasingly competitive business environment. For example, you can get Surface devices up and running with minimal interaction from your team. Setup is automatic and self-serviced. Updates are quick and painless for both your team and your users. You can manage devices regardless of their physical location.

Security and management features delivered with Azure Virtual Desktop on Surface include:

- **Windows Update.** Keeping Windows up to date helps you stay ahead of security threats. Windows 11 has been engineered from the ground up to be more secure and utilize the latest hardware capabilities to improve security. With a purpose-built UEFI <a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Windows Update for Business that responds to evolving threats, end-to-end protection is secure and simplified.
- **Hardware encryption.** Device encryption lets you protect the data on your Surface so only authorized individuals can  access it. All Surface for Business devices feature a discrete Trusted Platform Module (dTPM) that is hardware-protected against intrusion while software uses protected keys and measurements to verify software validity.
- **Microsoft Defender** [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint?) brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices. The tool is built-in and needs no extra agents to be deployed on devices or in the VDI environment, simplifying management and optimizing device startup.
- **Removable drives.** Most newer Surface devices feature removable SSD drives, providing greater control over data retention.
- **Modern authentication.** Microsoft 365 and Surface is a unified platform delivering every Windows security feature (subject to licensing and enablement). All Surface portfolio devices ship with a custom-built camera, designed for Windows Hello for Business, providing biometric security that persists seamlessly from on-device to VDI-based experiences.
- **Modern firmware management** -Using Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI), IT administrators can remotely disable hardware elements at a firmware level such as mics, USB ports, SD card slots, cameras, and Bluetooth, which removes power to the peripheral. Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security so that only privileged system software can access them.
- **Backward and forward compatibility.** Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices provide backward and forward compatibility across hardware, software and services. Microsoft has a strong history of maintaining legacy support of hardware, peripherals, software and services while incorporating the latest technologies. Businesses can plan IT investments to have a long useful life.
- **Bridge for legacy Windows 7 workloads.** For solution scenarios dependent on legacy Windows OS environments, enterprises can use VDI instances of Windows 7 running in Azure. This enables support on modern devices like Surface without the risk of relying on older Windows 7 machines that no longer receive the latest security updates. In addition to these "future-proofing" benefits, migration of any legacy workloads becomes greatly simplified when modern Windows 11 hardware is already deployed.
- **Zero-Touch Deployment.** Autopilot is the recommended modern management deployment option for Surface devices. You can use Windows Autopilot on Surface to remotely deploy and configure devices in a zero-touch process right out of the box. Windows Autopilot-registered devices are identified over the internet at first startup through a unique device signature called a hardware hash. They're automatically enrolled and configured using modern management solutions such as Microsoft Entra ID and mobile device management.

### Surface devices: Minimizing environmental impacts

Surface performs life cycle assessments to calculate the environmental impact of devices across key stages of the product life cycle enabling Microsoft to minimize these impacts. Each Surface product has an ECO profile with data on greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy consumption and material composition, packaging, recycling, and related criteria. To download profiles for each Surface device, see [ECO Profiles](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55974).
