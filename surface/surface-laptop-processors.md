# Surface Laptop 4 processors tech overview

Surface Laptop 4 is designed to provide commercial customers with a rich set of device options to help decision-makers better align device procurement goals with increasingly specific role requirements. Compared with Surface Laptop 3:

- Surface Laptop 4 equipped with AMD Ryzen™ Microsoft Surface Edition processors provides superior multi-threading performance making it a great choice for information workers needing better multitasking capabilities.
- Surface Laptop 4 equipped with 11th gen Intel® Core™ processors provide a stronger GPU and faster single-threaded performance, making it a great choice for developers, researchers, data scientists and the like - especially when paired with the greater memory and storage offered in the top end Intel SKU.

Choice of SKU depends on customer priorities:

- If multi-threaded app performance and longer battery life is a top priority, Surface Laptop 4 with AMD Ryzen Surface Edition processors is a good choice.
- If faster single-threaded performance is more important, along with options for greater memory and storage, Surface Laptop 4 with Intel 11th gen core processors is a good choice.
