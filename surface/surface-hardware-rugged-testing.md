# Surface hardware rugged testing

Surface devices are built to withstand rigorous conditions that help ensure optimal reliability and lower cost of ownership.

The MIL-STD-810 test standards, maintained by the US Department of Defense, help organizations evaluate how devices perform in the field. The testing program outlines multiple test methods across a range of environmental stress conditions. This is designed to test equipment limits in various conditions where it is expected to be used (environment) or transported (shocks). An independent third-party laboratory has tested the Surface devices listed below using recommended test methods. 

## MIL-STD-810 test results

Operational tests pass if the unit remained operational during the entire test, and non-operational tests pass if a functional verification was performed immediately after the test exposure. Tests were conducted in accordance with the MIL-STD-810 standards effective at the time of product release (MIL-STD-810H for Surface Laptop Go 2 and MIL-STD-810G for earlier devices).
