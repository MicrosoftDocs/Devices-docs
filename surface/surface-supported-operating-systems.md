> [!NOTE]
> The product key in the firmware activates only the operating system that is included together with the device. If a different operating system is installed, you must indicate the current product to activate it. For example, if the device is running on Windows 10 Home, you can restore or install only Windows 10 Home by using the available product key. Although you can install another system, such as Windows 8.1, you must supply a valid product key for that system to be able to activate it.

## More information

Surface Pro devices are optimized for 64-bit versions of the operating system. On these devices, 32-bit versions of Windows are unsupported. If a 32-bit version of the operating system is installed, it may not start correctly. This may occur if you try to start from external media, such as an attached USB or DVD drive. This may also occur if you try to start to an image that was applied to the local disk.
