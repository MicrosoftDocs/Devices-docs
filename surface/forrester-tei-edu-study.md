# The Total Economic Impact of Microsoft Surface for Education

Access to individual computing devices is critical for the education of K-12 students. Benefits of this access include better instruction, enhanced creativity and collaboration, fulfillment of accessibility and special learning requirements, and teaching workplace technology skill sets. Microsoft Surface devices create better outcomes for students, while also making it easier for IT organizations to support 1:1 student device models as well as freeing up teachers’ and administrators’ time.

Microsoft commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct a Total Economic Impact&trade; (TEI) study and examine the potential return on investment (ROI) for K-12 schools deploying Surface. The purpose of this study is to provide readers with a framework to evaluate the potential financial impact of Surface on their organizations. Adopting Surface as the device of choice for an institution improves student outcomes, helps overworked IT departments, frees up instructors’ time, and reduces total cost of ownership (TCO) for devices.
