# Manage USB ports on Surface devices

With USB port functionality enabled by default on Surface devices, many devices with Surface UEFI allow admins to turn off connectivity to USB ports. For example, you may wish to prevent users from copying data from USB thumb drives or external hard disks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the process outlined in this article, familiarize yourself with the following technologies and tools:

* [Surface UEFI](manage-surface-uefi-settings.md)
* [Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM)](surface-enterprise-management-mode.md)
* [PowerShell scripting](/powershell)
* [Deploy applications with Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-applications)

## Get started

The process consists of the following parts: 

1. **Enrollment:** Use Surface UEFI Configurator to enroll host devices and Surface docks into SEMM, following the instructions in [Secure Surface Dock ports with SEMM](secure-surface-dock-ports-semm.md). Surface Dock 2 or Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock are supported for this scenario. Key to this workflow is the ability to turn off USB-C data, Ethernet data, and USB-C audio whenever devices are disconnected from an authorized Surface Dock located, for example, in a  workplace environment handling highly sensitive information. 

2. **Client configuration:** Install **UEFI Manager**, available from [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703), on all Surface devices targeted for management.  

2. **Powershell scripts:** Go to [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) to download and modify the Powershell scripts as appropriate for your environment. Use Microsoft Configuration Manager to deploy the scripts (as applications) to target devices, following the instructions in [Use Microsoft Configuration Manager to manage devices with SEMM](use-system-center-configuration-manager-to-manage-devices-with-semm.md). 

Refer to the embedded comments for usage guidance. See [Appendix: SEMM Powershell Scripts tech reference](#appendix-semm-powershell-scripts-tech-reference) for definitions and prerequisites. 

## Manage USB-A ports 

For USB-A ports supporting USB-2 and USB-3, you can turn off the USB data protocol from the USB controller to prevent all functionality.

## Granular USB-C Disablement

Managing USB-C ports with their support for DisplayPort and USB Power Delivery provides more options beyond turning off all functionality. For example, you can prevent data connectivity to stop users from copying data from USB storage but retain the ability to extend displays and charge the device via a USB-C dock.

Beginning with Surface Pro 8, Surface Laptop Studio, and Surface Go 3, these options are now available via the SEMM PowerShell scripts.

1. Go to [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) and download **SEMM_PowerShell.zip**.

2. If you don't already have your own certificates, you can obtain certificates via the appropriate sample script, as documented in the [Appendix](#appendix-semm-powershell-scripts-tech-reference) on this page. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Keep certificates in a safe location and ensure they're properly backed up. Without them it's impossible to reset Surface UEFI, change managed Surface UEFI settings, or remove SEMM from an enrolled Surface device.

## Dynamic USB-C disablement: Surface Laptop Studio 2

Dynamic USB-C disablement is a new feature that enables customers operating in highly secure work environments to prevent USB theft of confidential data and provide more control to organizations. When paired with the Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock, IT admins can lock down USB-C ports whenever Surface Laptop Studio 2 is undocked or connected to an unauthorized dock. This means that when your users are connected to an authorized dock in the office, the USB-C ports will have full functionality over their devices. However, when they go off-site, they can still connect to a dock to use accessories or a monitor but cannot use the USB ports to transfer data. 

Dynamic USB-C disablement provides IT admins with greater flexibility to manage devices with a new "Mode 3" in addition to existing operational modes:
 
- **Mode 0 (Default Mode):** The default mode when SEMM is not configured.
- **Mode 1 (Data Disabled):** USB-C and Ethernet data are disabled. Audio via USB-C is also disabled. Display out and Power functionality is enabled.
- **Mode 2 (Fully Disabled):** USB-C and Ethernet data are disabled. Audio via USB-C is also disabled. Display out and Power functionality is disabled.
- **Mode 3 (USB Port Authenticated)** Aka Dynamic USB-C disablement. USB-C data, Ethernet data, USB-C audio, display out and power functions only when the device is connected to an authorized Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock. If connected to an unauthorized dock, only display out and Power functions will work. 

### Target behaviors

### Provisioning Surface docks

1. Use the appropriate provisioning script, as documented in the [Appendix](#appendix-semm-powershell-scripts-tech-reference) on this page. 

    - **ConfigureSEMM - Dock2.ps1** 
    - **ConfigureSEMM - Thunderbolt(TM)4Dock-Provisioning**

2. Open **ConfigureSEMM.ps1** and modify as appropriate. For example, to disable  USB-C ports, enable the following setting: **UsbPortHwDisabled.** See the following table for all available options.

### Department vs. organizational provisioning

Dynamic USB-C disablement allows for a many-to-many relationship between the host and dock. This lets customers have hosts and docks configured to work with all hosts/docks or make it department-specific to help with asset management.
