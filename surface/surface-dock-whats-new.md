## Connect multiple monitors to devices without USB4/Thunderbolt 4

You can daisy chain up to eight monitors by connecting a series of display devices using a wired connection from monitor to monitor in a series, rather than connecting each monitor directly to Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock.

To daisy chain monitors, you need two or more monitors that support at least **DisplayPort 1.2** and **Multi-Stream Transport (MST).** Displays that function as a middle link in the chain must include **DisplayPort** output ports and input ports. You also need a video or graphics card (GPU) on your PC that supports **DisplayPort 1.2** and **MST.**

> [!NOTE]
> Resolution and refresh rate is reduced when daisy chaining two or more monitors.

**To connect your PC to multiple monitors using DisplayPort MST:**

1. Connect your PC to the **DisplayPort-In** connection on the first monitor.
2. Connect the **DisplayPort-Out** connection on the first monitor to the **DisplayPort-In** connection on the second monitor. To daisy chain more than two monitors, follow a similar sequence: The first monitor connects to the second, the second monitor connects to the third, and so on.
3. Use the On-Screen Display (OSD) menu, to enable **DisplayPort 1.2** on your monitor. To learn more, refer to the user manual of your monitor.
