# What’s new in Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock

As the latest generation Surface dock, Surface Thunderbolt™ 4 Dock delivers ultra-high speed data transfer, built-in enterprise management and security[<sup>1</sup>](#references) and the versatility to connect your most important peripherals.

- **High-speed USB4®/Thunderbolt 4 on USB-C® ports.** Plug in one cable to power your device, connect two 4K monitors at up to 60 Hz[<sup>2</sup>](#references), and transfer data and files at up to 40 Gbps.
- **The charging power you need for your devices and accessories.** Connect and power your laptop with up to 96 watts of power passthrough and extra charging power for your phone and accessories.[<sup>3</sup>](#references)
- **More inclusive design with recycled materials.** Quickly access ports with raised tactile indicators for greater accessibility. The lightest Surface dock and PSU enclosures (excluding the AC cable) are attributed to 20% ocean-bound plastic.[<sup>4</sup>](#references) The packaging is ~99% recyclable in OECD countries and free of single-use plastics. The lightest Surface dock comes with 20% ocean-bound plastic and 99% recyclable packaging that’s free of single-use plastics[<sup>5</sup>](#references).

## Simple management and security from anywhere

Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock helps improve IT efficiency and reduce overhead and support costs through optimization for Microsoft software.

- **Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM) for Dock**. Designed to easily lock down the ports of your dock in mission-critical environments and restrict functionality to specific devices, enabling organizations to simplify and secure IT management. For more information, see [Secure Surface Dock ports with Surface Enterprise Management Mode](/surface/secure-surface-dock-ports-semm).
- **Firmware update through Windows Update**. Seamlessly keep your dock up to date with automatic updates or downloadable update driver and firmware packs.
- **MAC Address Passthrough.** [<sup>6</sup>](#references)Maintain device network identity from one dock to another for ease of management in shared workspaces or dock environments.
- **Wake on LAN from Modern Standby.** IT admins can remotely wake up devices connected to Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock and automatically perform management tasks
- **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) support**. IT admins can remotely monitor and manage the latest firmware, policy settings, and related data across Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock devices. For more information, see [Manage Surface Dock with WMI](/surface/surface-dock-wmi)
- **Centralized support & warranty service**. IT admins can get direct support via the [Surface Management Portal](surface-management-portal.md) or [Microsoft Hardware Support Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home).

## Connect multiple monitors to devices without USB4/Thunderbolt 4

You can daisy chain up to 10 monitors by connecting a series of display devices using a wired connection from monitor to monitor in a series, rather than connecting each monitor directly to Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock.

To daisy chain monitors, you need two or more monitors that support at least **DisplayPort 1.2** and **Multi-Stream Transport (MST).** Displays that function as a middle link in the chain must include **DisplayPort** output ports and input ports. You also need a video or graphics card (GPU) on your PC that supports **DisplayPort 1.2** and **MST.**

> [!NOTE]
> Resolution and refresh rate is reduced when daisy chaining two or more monitors.

**To connect your PC to multiple monitors using DisplayPort MST:**

1. Connect your PC to the **DisplayPort-In** connection on the first monitor.
2. Connect the **DisplayPort-Out** connection on the first monitor to the **DisplayPort-In** connection on the second monitor. To daisy chain more than two monitors, follow a similar sequence: The first monitor connects to the second, the second monitor connects to the third, and so on.
3. Use the On-Screen Display (OSD) menu, to enable **DisplayPort 1.2** on your monitor. To learn more, refer to the user manual of your monitor.
