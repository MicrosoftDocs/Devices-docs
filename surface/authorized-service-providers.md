# Surface repair by Microsoft authorized service providers

As part of our commitment to superior service and support, we're continuing to expand our network of authorized service providers (ASPs). ASPs work closely with Microsoft to help resolve issues that might occur with your Microsoft devices. ASPs perform repairs on behalf of Microsoft, have direct access to Microsoft support, and use genuine Microsoft parts.

## Global ASP network

The growing ASP network consists of more than 160 locations.
