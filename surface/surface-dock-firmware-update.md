# Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update

This article explains how to use Microsoft Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update to install and manage firmware on the original Surface Dock 1. When installed on your Surface device, it updates Surface Dock 1 devices attached to your Surface device.

> [!NOTE]
> This article does not apply to [Surface Dock 2](surface-dock2-overview.md), which receives updates automatically via Windows Update or by using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager or other MSI deployment tools. All current software, firmware, and drivers for the Surface Dock 2 can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101317).

This tool supersedes the earlier Microsoft Surface Dock Updater tool, previously available for download as part of Surface Tools for IT. The earlier tool was named Surface_Dock_Updater_vx.xx.xxx.x.msi (where x indicates the version number) and is no longer available for download and should not be used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains technical instructions for IT administrators. If you are a home user, please see [How to update your Surface Dock Firmware](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock)â€¯on the Microsoft Support site. The instructions at the support site are the same as the general installation steps below, but this article has additional information for monitoring, verifying, and deploying the update to multiple devices on a network.

## Supported devices

Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update is supported on the following devices:

- Surface Pro 3 and later
- Surface Pro X (all generations)
- Surface 3
- Surface Book (all generations)
- Surface Laptop Studio (all generations)
- Surface Studio (all generations)
- Surface Laptop (all generations)
- Surface Laptop Go (all generations)
- Surface Go (all generations)

### Minimum OS requirement

- Windows 10, version 1803 or later

## Install Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update

This section describes how to manually install the firmware update on Surface Dock 1.

> [!TIP]
> The MSI file Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update is not self-updating. If you have deployed the MSI to Surface devices and a new version of the firmware is released, you need to deploy the new version.

1. Go to [Surface Tools for IT](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) and download and install the .msi file named **Surface_Dock_FwUpdate..**, followed by the appropriate version. If you're running Surface Pro X, download the **.arm64** build. For all other devices, use the **.amd64** build.  

    - The update requires a Surface device running Windows 10, version 1803 or later.
    - Installing the MSI file might prompt you to restart Surface. However, restarting is not required to perform the update.

2. Disconnect your Surface device from the Surface Dock, wait ~5 seconds, and then reconnect. The Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update updates the dock silently in background. The process can take a few minutes to complete and continues even if interrupted.

## Monitor the Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update

This section is optional and provides an overview of how to monitor installation of the firmware update.

To monitor the update:

1. Open Event Viewer, browse to **Windows Logs > Application**, and then under **Actions** in the right-hand pane click **Filter Current Log**, enter **SurfaceDockFwUpdate** next to **Event sources**, and then click **OK**.

2. Type the following command at an elevated command prompt:

    ```console
    Reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WUDF\Services\SurfaceDockFwUpdate\Parameters"
    ```

3. Install the update as described in the [next section](#install-surface-dock-1-firmware-update) of this article.

4. Event 2007 with the following text indicates a successful update: **Firmware update finished. hr=0 DriverTelementry EventCode = 2007**.

   If the update is not successful, then event ID 2007 is displayed as an **Error** event rather than **Information**. Additionally, the version reported in the Windows Registry won't be current.

5. When the update is complete, updated DWORD values are displayed in the Windows Registry, corresponding to the current version of the tool. See the [Versions reference](#versions-reference) section in this article for details. For example:

    - Component10CurrentFwVersion 0x04ac3970 (78395760)
    - Component20CurrentFwVersion 0x04915a70 (76634736)

>[!TIP]
>If you see "The description for Event ID xxxx from source SurfaceDockFwUpdate cannot be found" in event text, this is expected and can be ignored.

Also see the following sections in this article:

- [How to verify completion of firmware update](#how-to-verify-completion-of-the-firmware-update)
  - [Event logging](#event-logging)
  - [Troubleshooting tips](#troubleshooting-tips)
  - [Versions reference](#versions-reference)

## Network deployment

You can use Windows Installer commands (Msiexec.exe) to deploy Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update to multiple devices across your network. When using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager or other deployment tool, enter the following syntax to ensure the installation is silent:

- **Msiexec.exe /i \<path to msi file\> /quiet /norestart**

For example:

```console
msiexec /i "\\share\folder\Surface_Dock_FwUpdate_1.42.139_Win10_17134_19.084.31680_0.msi" /quiet /norestart
```

> [!NOTE]
> A log file is not created by default. In order to create a log file, you need to append "/l*v [path]". For example: Msiexec.exe /i \<path to msi file\> /l*v %windir%\logs\ SurfaceDockFWI.log"

For more information, refer to [Command line options](/windows/win32/msi/command-line-options) documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to keep your Surface Dock updated using any other method, refer to [Update your Surface Dock](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock) for details.

## Intune deployment

You can use Intune to distribute Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update to your devices. First you need to convert the MSI file to the .intunewin format, as described in the following documentation: [Intune Standalone - Win32 app management](/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management).

Use the following command:

- **msiexec /i \<path to msi file\> /quiet /q**

## How to verify completion of the firmware update

Surface dock firmware consists of two components:

- **Component10:** Micro controller unit (MCU) firmware
- **Component20:** Display port (DP) firmware.

Successful completion of Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update results in new registry key values for these firmware components.

### To verify updates

1. Open Regedit and navigate to the following registry path:

    - **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WUDF\Services\SurfaceDockFwUpdate\Parameters**

2. Look for the registry keys: **Component10CurrentFwVersion and Component20CurrentFwVersion**, which refer to the firmware that is currently on the device.

3. Verify the new registry key values match the updated registry key values listed in the Versions reference at the end of this document. If the values match, the firmware was updated successfully.

4. If unable to verify, review Event logging and Troubleshooting tips in the next section.

## Troubleshooting tips

- Completely disconnect power for Surface dock from the AC power to reset the Surface Dock.
- Disconnect all peripherals except for the Surface Dock.
- Uninstall any current Surface Dock 1 Firmware Update and then install the latest version.
- Ensure that the Surface Dock is disconnected, and then allow enough time for the update to complete as monitored via an LED in the Ethernet port of the dock. Wait until the LED stops blinking before you unplug Surface Dock from power.
- Connect the Surface Dock to a different device to see if it is able to update the dock.
