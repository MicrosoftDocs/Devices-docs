# Surface portals overview

Surface portals provide a centralized solution for IT admins to manage and monitor Surface devices at scale:

- Centralize management of device warranties and support requests. Initiate single or bulk warranty claims.
- Gain insights into your warranty status and claims—in a single view.
- Quickly view the health of all your Surface devices and get notified about any unusual device status, which can help reduce IT costs.

Choose the option that’s right for you.

- **Surface Management Portal:** If your Surface devices are enrolled through Intune, they're automatically enrolled into the [Surface Management Portal](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Surface/SurfaceManagement.ReactView). In Intune Admin Center, go to **All Services** > **Surface Management Portal.** This includes the comprehensive feature set of the Intune admin center.
- **Surface Support Portal:** If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, your support service needs can be fulfilled via the [Microsoft 365 admin center.](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/support/microsofthardwaresupport) In Admin center, sign in and go to **Show all** > **Support** > **Microsoft Surface support**. This doesn't require your devices to be enrolled through Intune.
