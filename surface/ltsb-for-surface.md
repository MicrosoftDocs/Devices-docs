# Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) for Surface devices

>[!WARNING]
>For updated information on this topic, see [Surface device compatibility with Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Channel](surface-device-compatibility-with-windows-10-ltsc.md). For additional information on this update, see the [Documentation Updates for Surface and Windows 10 LTSB Compatibility](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/surface/2017/04/11/documentation-updates-for-surface-and-windows-10-ltsb-compatibility) post on the Surface Blog for IT Pros.

General-purpose Surface devices in the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) are not supported. As a general guideline, if a Surface device runs productivity software, such as Microsoft Office, it is a general-purpose device that does not qualify for LTSC and should instead be on the Semi-Annual Channel.

>[!NOTE]
>For more information about the servicing branches, see [Overview of Windows as a service](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/manage/waas-overview).

LTSC prevents Surface devices from receiving critical Windows 10 feature updates and certain non-security servicing updates. Customers with poor experiences using Surface devices in the LTSC configuration will be instructed to switch to the Semi-Annual Channel. Furthermore, the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition removes core features of Surface devices, including seamless inking and touch-friendly applications. It does not contain key in-box applications including Microsoft Edge, OneNote, Calendar or Camera. Therefore, productivity is impacted and functionality is limited. LTSC is not supported as a suitable servicing solution for general-purpose Surface devices.

General-purpose Surface devices are intended to run on the Semi-Annual Channel to receive full servicing and firmware updates and forward compatibility with the introduction of new Surface features. In the Semi-Annual Channel, feature updates are available as soon as Microsoft releases them.

Surface devices in specialized scenarios–such as PCs that control medical equipment, point-of-sale systems, and ATMs–might consider the use of LTSC. These special-purpose systems typically perform a single task and do not require feature updates as frequently as other devices in the organization.
