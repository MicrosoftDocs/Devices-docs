## Considerations for choosing your OS

Whether you choose to purchase new Surface devices running Windows 11 or opt for Surface devices with Windows 10<sup>1</sup> may depend on your current corporate environment:

- **Windows 10 only.** Designed for customers who require Windows 10 out of the box and deploy devices using Windows Autopilot or Microsoft Entra domain join (AADJ). With **Windows 10 SKUs**, you avoid the need to compile driver packs and reimage devices before distributing them to users. It includes an additional per-device fee of $30 or $50 depending on the device, as noted below. <sup>2</sup> (Prices are based on MSRP, actual pricing may vary.)
- **Windows 10 & Windows 11.** Designed for customers who use Windows 11 and also deploy Windows 10 via traditional deployment methods that rely on reimaging devices. With **Windows 11 SKUs**, you can take advantage of built-in downgrade rights to Windows 10 and load custom Windows 10 images on devices as needed.

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft Windows 10 Pro is preinstalled with Windows 10 downgrade software. It includes a license for the Downgrade Facilitation Product available via downgrade rights from Windows 11 Pro. The appropriate build is indicated in the [Windows OS versions](#windows-os-versions) section on this page. End users may use only one version at a time; switching between versions requires uninstalling the other version.

**Table 1. OS choice summary**

| Network environment     | Deployment method               | Recommended SKUs | Additional cost |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Windows 10 only         | Modern: Autopilot/AADJ          | Windows 10       | $30-$50 <sup>2</sup>        |
| Windows 10 & Windows 11 | Legacy: Custom image deployment | Windows 11       | None            |

### Windows 10 only

The ability to get the OS version you need directly from Surface includes delivery of factory shrink-wrapped devices fully configured with the requisite firmware, drivers, and security policies. The extra fee covers the cost of this service along with the following benefits that allow you to:

- Provide your users with the latest Surface hardware today while upgrading to Windows 11 at your own pace.
- Reduce your exposure to potential supply chain vulnerabilities by eliminating the need to reimage to Windows 10.
- Save time with Windows Autopilot zero-touch deployment, including faster app and policy updates and fewer help desk calls.

## Windows OS versions

Most devices ship from the factory with one of the following OS versions, depending on your choice. Surface Laptop Studio 2 ships from the factory with Windows 11 with the flexibility for customers to download an .msi file to install Windows 10.

> [!TIP]
> If you order devices from a reseller, please check with the reseller on the exact OS version that meets your requirements.
