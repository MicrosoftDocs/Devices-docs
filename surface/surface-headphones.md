# Surface Headphones 2+ tech overview

Built for the hybrid workplace, Surface Headphones 2+ reduce unwanted ambient noise, enable clear remote meeting participation, and provide high-fidelity sound. Surface Headphones 2+ include 13 levels of active noise cancellation, earcup dials, and advanced 8-microphone system for voice clarity, [18.5 hours of music](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-headphones-2-plus) <sup>1</sup> listening time or up to 15 hours of voice<sup>2</sup> calling time. 
 
## Certified for Microsoft Teams

Now certified for Microsoft Teams with the included dongle, Surface Headphones 2+ meet audio/video specification standards while in use with Teams software to ensure a high-quality call experience. It includes a Teams button to join calls or bring Teams to the forefront, integrated call controls, and an LED status indicator on the included dongle to indicate mute status.
 
## Using with Microsoft 365

Surface Headphones 2+ integrate with productivity features in Microsoft 365* such as helping improve the accuracy of speech to text dictation or enabling captions to appear on-screen while you speak during a presentation.

- Talk rather than type with dictation in Microsoft Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint.
- Enable live captions and subtitles on-screen while you’re talking, and translate what you’re saying into one of 60+ languages for more accessible presentations. 

Note that a software license is required for some Microsoft 365 features and is sold separately. To learn more, see [Use Microsoft 365 with Surface Headphones](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/use-microsoft-365-with-surface-headphones-917d98c2-7495-a6cf-97f8-e1b594e8ce7c).
 
## Updating firmware

- Headphones: users can update the headphone’s firmware via the [Surface Audio app](https://www.microsoft.com/p/surface-audio/9nxjnfwnvm8d?)Surface Audio app (Windows, iOS, Android).
- Dongle: Windows update will automatically push updates to the dongle’s firmware.
