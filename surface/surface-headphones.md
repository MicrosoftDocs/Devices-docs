# Surface Headphones 2+ overview

Built for the hybrid workplace, [Surface Headphones 2+](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/surface-headphones-2-plus) reduces unwanted ambient noise, enables clear remote meeting participation, and provides high-fidelity sound. Surface Headphones 2+ includes 13 levels of active noise cancellation, ear cup dials, and an advanced 8-microphone system for voice clarity, 18.5 hours of music <sup>1</sup> listening time or up to 15 hours of voice<sup>2</sup> calling time. 
 
## Certified for Microsoft Teams

Surface Headphones 2+ meets audio/video specification standards while using Teams software to ensure a high-quality call experience. A "Certified for Microsoft Teams" experience is enabled via one of the following methods: 

- **Surface USB link dongle**. Use the included dongle for a dedicated connection when using multiple Bluetooth® devices.
- **Bluetooth**. Now available for Windows 11, ensure you update the headphones to run the latest firmware, [as described below](#updating-firmware). A subsequent firmware update for the headphones to meet Teams certification standards on Windows 10 is coming soon. 

Surface Headphones 2+ includes a Teams button to join calls or bring Teams to the forefront, integrated call controls, and an LED status indicator on the dongle to indicate mute status.
 
## Using with Microsoft 365

Surface Headphones 2+ integrates with productivity features in Microsoft 365, such as helping improve the accuracy of speech-to-text dictation or enabling captions to appear on-screen while you speak during a presentation.

- Talk rather than type with dictation in Microsoft Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint.
- Enable live captions and subtitles on-screen while you’re talking, and translate what you’re saying into one of 60+ languages for more accessible presentations. 

A software license is required for some Microsoft 365 features and is sold separately. To learn more, see [Use Microsoft 365 with Surface Headphones](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/use-microsoft-365-with-surface-headphones-917d98c2-7495-a6cf-97f8-e1b594e8ce7c).
 
## Updating firmware

### Headphones

- For Apple Mac users, use the [Microsoft Accessory Updater tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-accessory-updater/id1599783787?mt=12) available from the Mac App Store.   
- Once you connect the Surface Headphones 2+ to your host device (PC/Mac), the update will automatically apply to the headphones.
- To confirm if your Surface Headphones 2+ received the update, go to the Surface App. Under Device information, verify the firmware version is **1.0.7.44** or later. If not, select **Update using Bluetooth, as shown below.**
