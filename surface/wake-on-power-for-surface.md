# Wake-on-Power for Surface devices

Surface devices can be powered off while you're away from your desk, or set to hibernate mode to save battery life. To improve the manageability of these devices, Wake-on-Power enables compatible Surface devices to automatically start when they're reconnected to power. To configure Wake-on-Power, you can use Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM) either through Surface UEFI Configurator or the UEFI Manager.

The Wake-on-Power feature is available on the following devices:

- Surface Pro 10 with 5G
- Surface Pro 11th Edition with 5G
- Surface Pro (11th Edition)
- Surface Pro 10 
- Surface Pro 9 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Pro 9 with 5G
- Surface Pro 8 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Pro 7+ (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Pro X (all SKUs)
- Surface Pro 7 (all SKUs)
- Surface Go 4 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Go 3 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop Studio 2 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop Studio (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Book 3 (all SKUs)
- Surface Laptop (7th Edition)
- Surface Laptop 6
- Surface Laptop 5 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop 4 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop 3 (Intel processors only)
- Surface Laptop Go 3 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop Go 2 (commercial SKUs only)
- Surface Laptop Go (all SKUs)
- Surface Studio 2+

>[!TIP]
> Commercial SKUs (aka Surface for Business) run Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise or Windows 11 Pro/Enterprise; consumer SKUs run Windows 10/Windows 11 Home. To learn more, see [View your system info](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/view-your-system-info-a965a8f2-0773-1d65-472a-1e747c9ebe00).

## Overview and prerequisites

Surface UEFI Configurator lets you save individual UEFI settings in a Windows Installer .msi package for distribution to target devices.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes that you know how to use SEMM. For more information, see [Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM)](surface-enterprise-management-mode.md) documentation.

## To enable Wake-on-Power

1. Download and install the [Surface IT Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=46703).
2. Open [UEFI Configurator](surface-it-toolkit-uefi-config.md) and follow the instructions to create a [UEFI Configuration package](/surface/surface-it-toolkit-uefi-config#create-a-surface-uefi-configuration-package) that turns on Wake on Power for targeted devices. 

3. Under **Advanced Settings**, toggle **Wake-on-Power** to **On**.

## Apply the MSI package

You can apply the MSI package to devices across your network by using software distribution tools such as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. This procedure includes steps to install the package on your local computer.

1. At an elevated command prompt, enter the full path of the .msi file to run the .msi package.

    ```cmd
    C:\SEMM\wake-on-power.msi 
    ```

2. In the **Warning** dialog box, select **OK** or disable BitLocker, as appropriate.

3. On the Welcome page, select **Next** to run the package and apply the newly configured UEFI settings.

4. Restart your device.

Wake-on-Power is now configured. To test the settings, turn off your device, disconnect the power, and then reconnect the power. The device should start automatically.
