6. Confirm your selections including the device model, Windows build, Office build (if applicable), and language pack. 
7. Under **USB Key Selection**, choose the USB to use for the recovery image. Make sure the USB drive you intend to use is correctly identified and ready to be formatted.
8. Select **Create** to start the process. A progress bar indicates that the recovery USB is ready to use.
9. Once the USB creation process reaches 100%, a confirmation message indicates that the recovery USB is ready to use.

Throughout the process, ensure you have a stable internet connection for the download and that no data you wish to keep is on the USB drive when formatted during the process. After the USB key is created, you can use it to restore the chosen Surface device back to its original state.
