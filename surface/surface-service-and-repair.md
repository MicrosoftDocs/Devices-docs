# Surface for Business service and repair

Built with integrity by design, many Microsoft Surface devices are now easier to repair<sup>1</sup> and maintain, providing commercial customers with greater flexibility while extending the use of devices. 

There are several ways commercial customers can obtain service for Surface for Business devices. You can get service [directly from Microsoft](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md) or use a third party [Authorized Service Provider](authorized-service-providers.md). Or with skilled technicians, you can repair<sup>2</sup> devices yourself following the applicable [Surface Service Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) or [article](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/replace-the-feet-on-surface-devices-791bcf1d-db4a-4807-816e-06d30072383d).

To learn more, see [Surface service options](surface-service-options.md).

## Surface devices and replacement components

Microsoft recommends that only technically inclined individuals with the knowledge, experience, and requisite tools perform repairs in accordance with the relevant [Surface Service Guide instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440).
