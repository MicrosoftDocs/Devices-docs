# Surface for Business service and repair

Built with integrity by design, many Microsoft Surface devices are now easier to repair<sup>1</sup> and maintain, providing commercial customers with greater flexibility while extending the use of devices. 

There are several ways commercial customers can obtain service for Surface for Business devices. You can get service directly from Microsoft or use a third party Authorized Service Provider. Or with skilled technicians, you can repair<sup>2</sup> devices yourself following official Microsoft instructions in downloadable service guides.

Choose one of the following options:

- **Microsoft in-region repair.**  Send devices for repair and return shipping. Create a repair order and mail your device using the prepaid shipping label provided by Microsoft. For details, see [Microsoft in-region repair](microsoft-in-region-same-unit-repair.md).
- **Authorized Service Providers.**  Send devices to an Authorized Service Provider (ASP) who perform repairs on Microsoft's behalf. For details, see [Surface repair by Microsoft Authorized Service Providers](authorized-service-providers.md).
- **Customer Self Repair.**  Self-repair devices using replaceable components available from device resellers. For details, see [Customer self-serve repair](surface-customer-self-repair-surface.md).

## Surface devices and replaceable components

Microsoft recommends that only technically inclined individuals with the knowledge, experience, and requisite tools perform repairs in accordance with the relevant [Surface Services Guide instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) available on the Microsoft Download Center. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Opening or repairing your device can present electric shock, device damage, fire and personal injury risks, and other hazards. Use caution if undertaking do-it-yourself repairs. Further, any resulting damage caused will not be covered under Microsoft's Limited Hardware Warranty or purchased protection plan.

> [!NOTE]
> Replaceable components have a 1-year Microsoft Limited Hardware Warranty<sup>3</sup> and can be purchased from a [Microsoft Authorized Device Reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface).
