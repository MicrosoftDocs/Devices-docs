This article describes what's in the Tool Library embedded with the Surface IT Toolkit. The Tool Library provides IT admins with a collection of additional tools and installers.

Each tool comes with a "Save Copy" option that allows the download and offline storage of the respective installer.

<!--The tools included in the library are kept up to date, ensuring that IT professionals have access to the latest versions for efficient and secure management of devices. Each tool comes with a "Save Copy" option, allowing IT admins to download and save a copy of the installer for the respective tool. This ensures that admins have the installers available for immediate or future deployment, even if offline access is required.

The Tool Library in the Surface IT Toolkit is a centralized repository that provides IT admins with a suite of tools essential for the configuration and support of Surface devices. This library ensures that the most up-to-date versions of each tool are readily available for deployment.-->
