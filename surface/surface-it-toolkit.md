# Surface IT Toolkit

The Surface IT Toolkit is a modern desktop application that compiles essential commercial tools and streamlines Surface device management for IT admins in a single application.

The Surface IT Toolkit ensures you're using the latest version thanks to MSIX, which automatically checks for updates and downloads them for you.
