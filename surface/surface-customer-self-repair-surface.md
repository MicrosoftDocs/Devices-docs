# Customer self-serve repair for Surface devices

You can perform self-serve repairs on Surface devices using the relevant [Surface Service Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) available from the Microsoft Download Center. 

Repairing your device with a replaceable component does not impact Microsoft's Limited Warranty; however, any damage to the device resulting from a repair performed by someone other than Microsoft or an Authorized Service Provider will not be covered under Microsoft's warranty or extended protection plans.

 Microsoft replaceable components are used to service or repair Surface devices and can support both in-warranty and out-of-warranty scenarios. Replaceable components have a 1-year Limited Hardware Warranty.<sup>1</sup> Replaceable components are available for purchase through [Microsoft's Authorized Distributors and Resellers](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS).

There are no certifications required to repair or service a Surface device. Still, Microsoft recommends that only technically inclined individuals with the knowledge, experience, and required tools perform repairs while following the instructions in the relevant [Surface Services Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) on the Microsoft Download Center. Opening or repairing your device can present electric shock, device damage, fire and personal injury risks, and other hazards. Use caution if undertaking do-it-yourself repairs.  Further, any damage you cause to the device or component will not be covered under Microsoft's Limited Hardware Warranty or a protection plan.
