# Customer self-serve repair for Surface devices

Technically inclined individuals with the knowledge, skills, and required tools can perform self-serve repairs<sup>1</sup> on eligible Surface devices by following the appropriate [Surface Service Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) from the Microsoft Download Center.

Self-repair replaceable components are available for purchase through [device resellers](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS). There are no certifications required to repair or service a Surface device. Replaceable components have a 1-year Limited Hardware Warranty.<sup>2</sup>

> [!TIP]
> Before proceeding with a service request, download the [Surface Diagnostic Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/surface/fix-common-surface-problems-using-the-surface-app-and-surface-diagnostic-toolkit-f61d8d18-37a9-863d-f8d0-1982eb16f7b5) for automated hardware tests on components, including the power supply, battery, display, and sound.

## How to open a self-serve repair request

This section explains how self-repair works for commercial customers.

> [!NOTE]
> Self-serve replaceable components are currently **only available for purchase separately**, independent of the warranty status of your device.

### Example: Surface Laptop 5: Replace cracked display

In this scenario, a customer must replace a broken display on their Surface Laptop 5. (Follow the same process for all other part requests for repairable Surface devices.)

1. First, you need to obtain the appropriate part number for the replaceable part and order it from an authorized device reseller. In this example, you would need the part number that corresponds to the display size and color of the device.
2. Go to [Surface Service Guides](https://www.microsoft.com/download/100440) and download the **Surface Laptop 5 Service Guide** (available in English, French, Japanese, or Simplified Chinese). This page contains links to all available Service Guides for Surface devices.
3. Go to the Illustrated Parts List and look for the display (7).

4. Look up the part number; specifically, the CRU Part No (customer replaceable unit): in this example, the CRU Part No for a Platinum 15-inch Surface Laptop 5 is **U71-00001**.

> [!TIP]
> Order self-service parts using the CRU number. Ignore ASP/FRU part numbers. Each Surface Service Guide contains an Illustrated Parts List followed by a table that contains CRU numbers for replaceable parts.  

5. Contact an [Authorized Device Reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/business/where-to-buy-microsoft-surface#DEVICESRESELLERS) and let them know you need a new display for your Surface Laptop 5. Provide the reseller with the CRU part number; in this example, U71-00001.
6. The reseller confirms the part availability and places an order with their Authorized Device Distributor. Parts are shipped to the reseller or directly to you.

> [!NOTE]
> Part availability may vary due to supply chain constraints, customer demand, and related issues.

> [!CAUTION]
> Repairing your device with a replaceable component doesn't affect Microsoft's Limited Warranty; however, any damage to the device resulting from a repair performed by someone other than Microsoft or an Authorized Service Provider won't be covered under Microsoft's warranty or extended protection plans.
