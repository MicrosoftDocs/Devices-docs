# Manage DFCI on Surface devices

## Introduction

With Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI) profiles built into [Microsoft Intune](/mem/autopilot/dfci-management), Surface UEFI management extends the modern management stack down to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) hardware level. DFCI supports zero-touch provisioning, eliminates BIOS passwords, provides control of security settings, including boot options and built-in peripherals, and lays the groundwork for advanced security scenarios in the future. This page lists [all DFCI policy settings](#dfci-policy-settings-reference-for-surface-devices) on eligible Autopilot-deployed Surface devices.

Designed to be used with software-level mobile device management (MDM), DFCI enables IT admins to remotely disable specific hardware components and prevent end users from accessing them. For example, if you need to protect sensitive information in highly secure areas, you can disable the camera, and if you don't want users booting from USB drives, you can disable that also.

> [!TIP]
> Support for some DFCI policy settings varies by device. Review the [DFCI policy settings reference](#dfci-policy-settings-reference-for-surface-devices) on this page and follow [Intune instructions](/mem/intune/configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows) to configure and deploy settings to your devices.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 1809 (released November 2018)
- Devices must be registered with Windows Autopilot via one of the following methods:
  - [Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider)
  - [Directly from Surface](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/supportrequestform/0d8bf192-cab7-6d39-143d-5a17840b9f5f)

> [!NOTE]
> Devices manually or self-registered for Autopilot, such as imported from a CSV file, aren't allowed to use DFCI. By design, DFCI management requires external attestation of the device's commercial acquisition via a Microsoft CSP partner or Surface registration.

> [!NOTE]
> DFCI in Intune includes three settings that don't currently apply to Surface devices: (1) CPU and IO virtualization, (2) Disable Boot from network adapters, and (3) Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT).

## Get started

1. Sign in to your tenant at endpoint.microsoft.com.
2. In the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center, select **Devices > Configuration profiles > Create profile**.
3. Under Platform, select **Windows 10 and later**.
4. Under Profile type, select **Templates** > **Device Firmware Configuration Interface** and then select **Create.**

   :::image type="content" source="images/dfci-start.png" alt-text="Start creating DFCI profile":::

5. See [Use DFCI profiles on Windows devices in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/device-firmware-configuration-interface-windows) for complete instructions, including:

   - Create your Azure AD security groups
   - Create the profiles
   - Assign the profiles and reboot
   - Update existing DFCI settings
   - Reuse, retire, or recover the device

## Prevent users from changing UEFI settings

For many customers, the ability to block users from changing UEFI settings is critically important and a primary reason to use DFCI. As listed above in Table 1, this functionality is managed via the setting **Allow local user to change UEFI settings**. If you don't edit or configure this setting, the local user can change any UEFI setting not managed by Intune. Therefore, it's highly recommended to set **Allow local user to change UEFI settings** to **None.**

:::image type="content" source="images/dfci-configure.png" alt-text="Block user access to change UEFI settings":::

## Verify UEFI settings on DFCI-managed devices

In a test environment, you can verify settings in the Surface UEFI interface.

1. Open Surface UEFI:
   - Press and hold the **volume-up button** on your Surface and, at the same time, press and release the **power** button.
   - When you see the Surface logo, release the volume-up button. The UEFI menu will display within a few seconds.

2. Select **Devices**. The UEFI menu will reflect configured settings, as shown in the following figure.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Surface UEFI." source="images/df3.png":::

   Note:

     - The settings are grayed out (inactive) because **Allow local user to change UEFI setting** is set to **None**.
     - On-board Audio is set to off because the **Microphones and speakers** policy is set to **Disabled**.

## Remove DFCI policy settings

When you create a DFCI profile, all configured settings will remain in effect across all devices within the profile's scope of management. You can only remove DFCI policy settings by editing the DFCI profile directly. If the original DFCI profile has been deleted, create a new profile and edit the appropriate settings.

### Removing DFCI management

**To remove DFCI management and return device to factory new state:**

1. Retire the device from Intune:
   1. In Endpoint Manager at endpoint.microsoft.com, choose **Devices** > **All Devices**. 
   1. Select the device you want to retire, then choose **Retire/Wipe.** 
   To learn more, see [Remove devices by using wipe, retire, or manually unenrolling the device](/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe).
2. Delete the Autopilot registration from Intune:
   1. Choose **Device enrollment > Windows enrollment > Devices**.
   2. Under Windows Autopilot devices, choose the devices you want to delete, then choose **Delete**.
3. Connect the device to wired internet with a Surface-branded ethernet adapter. Restart the device and open the UEFI menu (press and hold the volume-up button while also pressing and releasing the power button).
4. Select **Management > Configure > Refresh from Network**, and then choose **Opt-out.**

To manage the device with Intune but without DFCI management, self-register it to Autopilot and enroll it in Intune. DFCI won't be applied to self-registered devices.
